> Sameera Talegawkar, DGAC [02:11:05]
> 
> So we did have this question and, can you describe the limitations of the data, because it was a bit frustrating, like after looking at everything and there was a lot of public comments that we received on this particular question. So I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about that and if you have any specific research recommendations, regarding this question, like for future committees, you know, just to consider for the research community in general so that their body of evidence can be considered by future committees.
> 
> Deanna Hoelscher, DGAC [02:11:40]
> 
> So, when we started that systematic review, one of the issues was how do you classify ultra processed foods because there's several classification schemes right now. 
> 
> So Nova is the most well known, but there's others as well. And so we wanted to be more inclusive. 
> 
> So we let the authors of the study determine what they meant by ultra processed foods. So when you got that, you had some kind of, you had consistent types of foods show up, but it was hard for us to come up with a succinct definition for ultra processed foods. And that's not available in the literature now, although several groups are working toward that right now.
> 
> So I think until we get a better definition for what we mean as ultra processed foods, it's going to be difficult to look at this. 
> 
> The other issue was a lot of these studies that we reviewed were from other countries. So what they had as ultra processed food might be different than what you would find here. So there were several issues associated with that.
> 
> ...
> 
> Edward Giovannucci, DGAC [02:13:07]
> 
> It's obviously an important issue, but, you know, I think it's more a question of how it's been studied or is being studied and it's a relatively new area of research. 
> 
> But you know, it's also important to note that like the foods, like all the foods that are recommended as part of a healthy dietary pattern, would generally not be considered ultra processed foods by any standard definition. 
> 
> And, we do mention sugar sweetened beverages, items like that, that would be likely considered ultra processed foods. 
> 
> So I think it's the-- the pattern somewhat covers ultraprocesed foods indirectly, because you know, part of nutrition is, or part of the pattern rationale is, you know, it's not just what you're eating, but at the same time what you're not eating. 
> 
> So, I think it, it kind of covers ultra processed foods indirectly, but I mean, I think it's certainly something that as more research is coming out, hopefully in the future we will be able to make more direct statements regarding it.
> 
> ...
> 
> Christopher Gardner, DGAC [02:14:56]
> 
> There's a-- the public is very interested in this because it's all over the media, right? And it just seems like such a timely opportunity to address this, given that we're revising the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. 
> 
> But the reality here is most of the publications are observational epi studies. These prospective cohort studies that have data from 30 and 40 years ago. And so we have two issues. 
> 
> One is we didn't have that level of ultra processed foods 30 or 40 years ago. So they were, they weren't actually even there. And the second one is the most current definition is clearly Nova. Nova actually isn't as much nutrients as it is the purpose of the ingredients that were added. And the main categories there is called cosmetic additives. And there's another really bizarre category that's called of no or rare culinary use, which means it's only used in industrial settings. You wouldn't find it in a restaurant. You wouldn't find it usually at home. And it's an extensive list. 
> 
> It's really, really, it's so extensive that nobody's ever had the time to look at each one of these additives one at a time they're sort of all grouped together. They're not in the data sets. So as people move forward with these studies, they are saying, okay, I'm looking at what items are in the food frequency questionnaire data that we collected. And I'm kind of assuming the ultra processed ones are in this group and in this group, but there's a huge limitation in the assessment of that and the conclusions that you can draw. 
> 
> And so unfortunately as much as the public is seeing this in the headlines and as much as the papers are coming out, until we have better tools for not only defining it, but even after we've defined it, finding those foods that we know have the cosmetic additives that, oh my gosh, that that's really a long way off. 
> 
> So we can make some very practical recommendations at this time. But the level of evidence can't get anywhere further than limited because of the difficulties with assessment would be my comment.
> 
> ...
> 
> Deirdre Kay Tobias, DGAC [02:20:36]
> 
> I think in five years from now, that's not going to be an issue that goes away. And we'll have a lot more clinical, experimental and epi evidence.
> 
> The definition, you know, as we know, hasn't been intended to capture like a health outcome. It's for like exclusively delineating by processing techniques. 
> 
> So its intent is, what it is, but I think for the next five years, the research is going to explode. So revisiting, it will probably be if anything, even more of a priority. 
> 
> And then the other aspect of that was, you know, as we move towards a more, I don't know, acceptable definition if one's actually needed or a one that can be more easily communicated if that's necessary in the end, is one consideration. 
> 
> But I think we really felt it was more the volume of literature being sparse than the definition alone explaining that because we ran into that same issue with all the patterns we looked at being vague or not quantitative. 
> 
> So in five years, hopefully this isn't sort of punted again for another five.

- **Date:** received October 16, 2024

> **Is mycoplasma continuing to trend up in children ages 2 to 4 years old?**
> 
> In August 2024, the percentage of pneumonia-associated emergency department (ED) visits with an M. pneumoniae-related diagnostic code peaked at 10.7% for those by persons aged 2–4-years and 9.8% for those by persons aged 5–17 years. Since then, the percentage has dropped slightly for 2–4-year-olds.
> 
> **Are there some regions currently seeing higher mycoplasma rates than others?**
> 
> Though we have seen an increase in every region, the highest levels are in HHS Regions 6 and 7, while the lowest are in HHS regions 9 and 10. It is important to note that while the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) collects data from the vast majority of emergency departments, it isn’t 100% so there may be regions of the country with more or less reporting.
> 
> **What share of pneumonia diagnoses right now are mycoplasma?**
> 
> As of September 21, 2024, the percentages of pneumonia-associated ED visits with an M. pneumoniae-related diagnostic were 1.8% among people of all ages. Specifically:
> 
> ·       4.8% (53/1117) among persons aged 0–1-year
> 
> ·       6.8% (133/1956) among persons aged 2–4-years

## Lincoln Hospital and Clinics on IV shortage update 

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** Lincoln Hospital and Clinics spokesperson Tyson Lacy
- **Date:** received October 16, 2024

> We are still seeing a shortage of fluids on all sizes of bags.  Baxter has increased their allocations, but as of today, we have still not received orders from our allocation.  We receive orders once per week from Baxter and anticipate some sort of allocation order tomorrow (Thursday).  Baxter has indicated what our allocations should be, but we won't know with 100% certainty until we received them. 
> 
> I don't believe it has had an impact on patient care as of this point.  We have asked our physicians and providers to determine what fluids are needed based on the patient's needs at the time of presentation.  We have temporarily halted our elective procedures that require IV fluids, prioritizing hospitalized and emergency patients.  We will re-evaluate our pause on procedures next week after we see what allocations of fluids materialize.

## Allina Health on IV shortage update

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Allina Health spokesperson Jennifer Steingas
- **Date:** received October 15, 2024

> Due to our effective conservation efforts, Allina Health resumed clinical operations at all sites across our system late last week. This does not mean the shortage of IV fluid supplies is over. Allina Health anticipates continuing to receive less than normal amounts of IV fluid resources through the end of the year. We will continue many of our conservation efforts and monitor and assess our supplies daily for the foreseeable future.  
> 
> This has been an especially difficult time for some of our patients who had their surgeries or procedures impacted. We are quickly working to reschedule them in a prioritized manner and thank them for their understanding and patience. We also express our gratitude to the state and federal officials and hospital associations who continue to help us raise the urgency of the IV fluid shortage.

- **Date:** received October 15, 2024

> At Mount Nittany Health, we are closely monitoring our supply of IV fluids and have implemented conservation measures to ensure continued availability. We have not had to postpone, delay, or cancel any procedures as of yet thanks to the diligence of our team members. We have had some of our allocations increased over the past week, but anticipate the need to sustain conservation efforts for the next few months. We will continue to work with physicians and front line staff to evaluate alternative delivery methods of these fluids, and other ways of handling clinical needs without impacting the quality of care for our patients.

## UVA Health on IV shortage update

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** UVA Health spokesperson Eric Swensen
- **Date**: received October 15, 2024

> Our supply is roughly the same. Full statement below.
> 
> UVA Health University Medical Center will proceed with most scheduled elective procedures through Wednesday, Oct. 16. However, given the continued constraint on irrigation fluids, the health system has partnered with surgeons to scale back procedures with high-volume irrigation fluid use. University Medical Center is reassessing the situation to determine what is feasible for the remainder of the week.
> 
> At UVA Health’s hospitals in Culpeper, Haymarket and Manassas, elective surgeries resumed Tuesday, Oct. 15.
> 
> UVA Health representatives are contacting patients if their elective surgeries need to be postponed and will continue to monitor the supply situation in the coming days. Any postponed surgeries will be rescheduled as soon as possible once the critical IV supplies become more available.

## Children's Minnesota on IV shortage update

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Children's Minnesota
- **Date:** received October 15, 2024

> Children's Minnesota is encouraged to see the progress made by Baxter International as it recovers from the devastating effects of Hurricane Helene. Last week, we received news that as a pediatric health system caring for vulnerable patient populations, we are among the systems that will be receiving increased allocation of product from Baxter Healthcare based on our usage between March and Aug. 2024. We have not seen the full allocation (all fluids, all sizes) yet as Baxter continues to recover from Hurricane Helene, but we are receiving some of the ordered shipments of fluids weekly and will continue to work closely with Baxter as we work through this time of shortage.    
> 
> Like other health systems, Children's Minnesota is still taking extra precautions to conserve IV fluid product because those allocations don't take into consideration the increase in patients due to the limited supply at other systems, and the annual anticipated increase in fall patient volumes due to respiratory illness. 
> 
> Some examples of conservation efforts include:   
> 
> Actively assessing patients and immediately discontinuing all non-essential use of IV solutions and irrigation solutions in the ED.  
> 
> Clinically evaluating each patient prior to initiating IV fluids.  
> 
> Emergency departments, surgical units, intensive care units, med/surg, hospital medicine, pharmacy and other areas have very specific conservation efforts.  
> 
> While we have not yet delayed any procedures, this is a serious, fast-moving situation that requires real-time decision-making. Leaders across our organization are meeting daily to monitor the situation and take action. Our patients are our number one priority and every decision we make is in service of their best possible care.

## Mass General Brigham on IV shortage update

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Mass General Brigham spokesperson Michael Morrison
- **Date:** received October 15, 2024

> I wanted to point out that we are not cancelling all elective procedures, but some that require certain specific IV fluids. I can also let you know that we have not yet seen an increase in our regular allocation from Baxter but do expect an additional one-time shipment this week to address urgent concerns.
> 
> Statement from Mass General Brigham re: deferring certain procedures due to IV fluid shortage  
> 
> As healthcare providers across the country continue to confront the national IV fluid shortage following the devastating effects of Hurricane Helene, Mass General Brigham has made the difficult decision to defer some non-emergent, elective procedures requiring certain IV fluids from Sunday, October 13, through at least Wednesday, October 16. While we strive to minimize any impact on patients, these measures will ensure we are able to care for those in immediate need. Due to the unpredictable nature of this situation, we do not know when our supply of IV fluids will improve but we are closely monitoring and will continuously evaluate to ensure we can return to normal operations as soon as possible. We are contacting affected patients and will work to reschedule them as soon as we are able. 

## Veterans Affairs on IV shortage update

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Veterans Affairs Press Secretary Terrence Hayes:
- **Date:** received October 15, 2024

> “At this time, VA has not identified any procedure cancelations as a result of this shortage. VA is closely tracking inventory, shipments, cross-leveling supply between facilities when appropriate, and following general conservation guidance to maximum use of existing supplies. We will continue to take all necessary actions to serve Veterans, maintain continuity of care, and ensure patient safety.”

## HHS official on IV shortage update

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Department of Health and Human Services official
- **Date:** received October 15, 2024

> “Ensuring people have medical supplies they need is a top priority of the Administration. It’s exactly why we are working closely with Baxter to support cleanup and restoration of the facility, including invoking the Defense Production Act to help production resume as quickly as possible. The Administration also moved quickly to open up imports from five facilities around the world and make it easier for hospitals to produce their own IV fluid during the shortage. As a result of these actions, 50% more IV fluid is available now compared to right after the hurricane. HHS is using all necessary authorities to bolster supply and mitigate impact to patients over the coming weeks.”

## Main Line Health on IV shortage update

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Jonathan Stallkamp, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Main Line Health
- **Date:** received October 15, 2024

> Main Line Health continues to experience a shortage of IV fluids. Despite maximizing our conservation strategies, unless supplies arrive, we may be forced shortly to cancel some elective surgeries. Although Baxter has increased allocations of some fluids, it has further restricted others. One-liter bags of 0.9% saline — our most commonly used fluids — are on back order, with no shipments expected for at least 3½ weeks. If so and alternate supplies cannot be obtained, we may have to curtail other services. 

## Mount Sinai Health System on IV shortage update

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** Mount Sinai Health System spokesperson Elizabeth Dowling
- **Date:** received October 14, 2024

> Because Mount Sinai uses a Baxter competitor for IV fluids, we are not as affected as others. With that being said, our supply team has been having regular conversations with our vendor to discuss the allocations that have been placed to ensure there is not a run on product. Mount Sinai has also been preparing for these types of situations by having safety stock set aside.

## Cleveland Clinic on IV shortage update

- **Attribution:** Cleveland Clinic spokesperson Katrina Healy
- **Date:** received October 15, 2024

> We have not cancelled or postponed any surgeries or procedures. 
> 
> We are closely monitoring this situation and have been implementing conservation strategies while continuing to care for all patients.  All patient needs are being met.

## FDA spokesperson on IV shortage update

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** Food and Drug Administration spokesperson Chanapa Tantibanchachai
- **Date:** received October 15, 2024

> We just added three new parenteral drug products to the drug shortages database. The FDA now considers Dextrose 70% IV solution, Lactated Ringers IV solution, and Peritoneal Dialysis solution to not be commercially available in adequate supply to meet national demand.
> 
> You’ll have to ask Baxter regarding the second point. And the importations are from Baxter’s facilities.
> 
> You’re obviously already keeping an eye on our website, but please continue to do so! We’ll post updates there: https://www.fda.gov/drugs/updates-2024-hurricane-season/hurricane-helene-baxters-manufacturing-recovery-north-carolina

## FDA webinar on voluntary sodium reduction

- **Source:** [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPz-J02-yFM)
- **Attribution:** published by the Food and Drug Administration
- **Date:** posted October 10, 2024

> Quesiton [00:23:00]
> 
> Our first question is why are these sodium reduction goals voluntary and not mandatory?
> 
> Robin McKinnon, FDA [00:23:09]
> 
> I can take that one, Janesia.
> 
> So at this time, we're not exploring mandatory sodium targets. We're focused on the implementation of the voluntary targets. 
> 
> Currently, we believe that a voluntary, iterative approach is the most effective and appropriate approach. And we're pleased to be seeing some initial progress already.
> 
> Voluntary targets for a broad array of food categories have shown success in other parts of the world, as I mentioned in Canada and the United Kingdom. So this is a reasonable approach for now. 
> 
> We think that the real value lies in allowing both the FDA and the food industry to have a common system for defining and measuring progress in reducing sodium in the food supply. And we'll certainly continue to engage with industry to learn about their successes, potential challenges in achieving the targets.
> 
> As palates adjust to lower sodium a company's product could taste overly salty by comparison. So we certainly encourage all industry groups to work towards the targets.
> 
> ...
> 
> Lauren Zhovmer, FDA [00:30:16]
> 
> Our analysis of the food supply using the 2022 data is, again, it's preliminary. We don't know yet the full extent of the progress towards the phase one goals, but regarding the preliminary analysis, there's various reasons why we might see some categories increase in sodium.
> 
> There's-- this mainly includes shifting sales at the top sellers, which may have been reformulated with lower sodium or even higher sodium, there's new product introductions into the category, or even discontinuations of products. And also just the availability of data to us for the category. 
> 
> These can all impact measured category levels.

- **Date:** received October 10, 2024

> Our Daytona Beach IV solutions manufacturing site and distribution center were not seriously impacted by Hurricane Milton and will resume operations as planned on Friday morning, October 11. We understand from discussions with employees that there have been no reported injuries, but many are still without power. We are especially thankful to the employees who remained at the site to provide updates throughout the storm.
> 
> To safeguard the supply of finished products, we worked closely with the federal government, specifically the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), to leverage their resources which allowed us to move more than 60 truckloads of IV solutions inventory from our Daytona Beach distribution center to a secure, temperature-controlled facility, north of Florida. The product will now be returned to our distribution site.
> 
> We are in daily contact with officials from ASPR, the Drug Shortage staff at CDER (Center for Drug Evaluation and Research) and the Department of Health and Human Services to address this issue and help alleviate any impact on patient care.

## FDA spokesperson on monograph forecast

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Food and Drug Administration spokesperson Cherie Duvall-Jones
- **Date:** received October 7, 2024

> The monograph forecast is a nonbinding document and does not mean with certainty that the FDA will propose action within the next three years; however, it does reflect what the FDA is currently considering a priority over the next three years.
> 
> A proposed order addressing the generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) status of codeine and related salts as antitussive active ingredients is currently listed on the monograph forecast. Codeine, codeine phosphate, and codeine sulfate, when used in combination with other cough-cold active ingredients, are currently considered GRASE when they are (1) indicated for OTC use as antitussives in adults and children 6 years of age and older and (2) marketed consistent with all applicable antitussive monograph conditions and other applicable requirements. With respect to whether the concern is safety or effectiveness, both can be intertwined and the FDA is re-evaluating the GRASE status in light of the risks associated with codeine-containing cough medicines.
> 
> The proposed order to address the GRASE status of OTC phenylephrine as an oral decongestant is also listed on the monograph forecast. Oral phenylephrine is currently considered GRASE for use as a nasal decongestant in adults and children ages 2 years of age and older. In September 2023, FDA held a Non-prescription Drug Advisory Committee meeting to discuss the effectiveness of oral phenylephrine as an active ingredient in OTC cough-cold products that are indicated for the temporary relief of congestion, both as a single ingredient product and in combination with other ingredients. The committee discussed new data on the effectiveness of oral phenylephrine and concluded that the current scientific data do not support that the recommended dosage of orally administered phenylephrine is effective as a nasal decongestant. Please read the CDER Statement for more information about the results and next steps related to the FDA’s advisory committee meeting on the GRASE status of oral phenylephrine in nasal decongestant drug products.

- **Date:** received October 7, 2024

> Today the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing a plan to begin public health entry screening at three U.S. airports for people coming from the Republic of Rwanda to reduce the risk of importation of Marburg virus disease (Marburg) into the United States. Starting mid October, airline passengers who have been in Rwanda in the last 21 days will have their travel to the United States rerouted to Chicago (ORD), New York (JFK), and Washington DC (IAD) where these travelers will undergo public health entry screening upon arrival.
> 
> Currently, Rwanda is experiencing an outbreak of Marburg, a rare, severe viral hemorrhagic fever similar to Ebola. The risk of Marburg in the U.S. remains low, however, these measures are being taken out of an abundance of caution given the ongoing outbreak in Rwanda.

> Dawn O'Connell, ASPR [00:31:02]
> 
> One of the concerns we have at ASPR is on the medical health supply chain. 
> 
> As soon as we heard that there was a situation, with the Baxter plant in Marion, we reached out and spoke to the CEO Saturday night. We had our teams meeting for the first time Sunday morning, and we've been meeting daily since then. 
> 
> I think folks know Baxter, has been-- they provide 60% of the nation's IV fluids and we are working to, and they are working and have been a terrific partner in trying to find additional supply. 
> 
> They have fortunately plants across the world that they are looking to access supply from and bring in to be able to staunch which is the difficulty right now for them of being able to access their plant. 
> 
> There was a bridge that went out and that was the bridge that would bring things back and forth. 
> 
> They've been able to for their industry, they've invested in this, on their own, put a rock bridge in to begin to get some of the machines in to help augment and begin to clean up and get it back online. They also had some supply in their plant that they thought was salvageable. They're looking at that to try to get that into the supply chain.
> 
> But from the federal perspective, we've been in lockstep with them helping to secure whatever bridge access they needed, and also to look around for additional suppliers who could fill the gap while they begin to ramp back up. 
> 
> But I will say, it's a concern of ours, but Baxter's been a wonderful partner in trying to minimize the impact on the supply chain. 
> 
> Of course, we saw the east coast port situation get resolved overnight. That was an additional pinch that we were worried about. 
> 
> But that's now less of a concern and we're focused on getting Baxter back up and ready to go. And they've been a terrific partner in all of us and are very concerned about this as well, but we continue to meet regularly to assist.
> 
> ...
> 
> Andrea Palm, HHS [00:32:59]
> 
> I would just say to that end, the Food and Drug Administration, also a member of the HHS family of agencies, and as Dawn noted, there are a couple of other domestic manufacturers for some of these products. 
> 
> And we through our colleagues at FDA are in touch with those manufacturers about the opportunity for them to ramp up as Baxter is getting itself square and assessing their situation and getting back online and back up to full capacity. 
> 
> But we're again, pulling all the levers we have at HHS to make sure we're leaning in to support this work more broadly, including our colleagues at FDA.

> Robert Califf, FDA [00:27:21]
> 
> If you look underneath it all, whenever you say government agencies, there's a negative reaction by a large part of our society. 
> 
> Unfortunately, a lot of that's driven by politics and the cultural divide, very hard to deal with. 
> 
> But if you look at people's individual interactions with people that work in these spheres, they're not so negative.

> And I think you see that right now, going on with Helene, if you're on the ground in the Asheville area, there's a lot of good collaboration and hard work going on.

> And what's happened, it's been called a race to the bottom, as generic drugs, over 90% of our prescriptions have become commoditized, the price has gotten so low that you can't afford to make them and distribute them with U.S. labor costs at the current price. 
> 
> And unfortunately, in my view, the purchasers driven by our own U.S. health systems are so interested in the lowest price, they don't build resilience criteria into the contracting. And so, this is a real mess. 
> 
> And something that's talked about a lot less is that on the device side, the very low cost devices, syringes, stop cocks, we're down to one syringe maker now in the U.S., it's all-- and PPE, you remember when there was all the upset about gowns and gloves and masks, that's all moved back to China now. 
> 
> So, we're working, uh, with Congress to try to get fixes to the system that would require resilience as part of the effort and bring back. 
> 
> We don't need it all manufactured in the U.S., but we need enough in the U.S. and so-called friend-shored that we're not susceptible to these lapses that occur, that create real hardship in problems in the clinical care community.

> Who would have thought we wouldn't have enough normal saline and Ringer's lactate for the country?
> 
> They were already in shortage. And now this plant went down in Asheville, due the hurricane. 
> 
> So in the meanwhile, we try to fix it up without having access to the data we need, because that's been blocked.

- **Attribution:** Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response spokesperson
- **Date:** received October 4, 2024

> As part of ASPR’s preparedness mission, the agency has invested approximately $365 million dollars into medical countermeasures - a vaccine and antibody treatment - for filoviruses, such as Marburg.
> 
> We have invested over $235 million into the development of Sabin’s ChAd3-based filovirus vaccines that target Marburg virus and Sudan ebolavirus.
> 
> Another $129 million has been invested into the development of Mapp Biopharmaceutical’s MBP-091 monoclonal antibody for treatment of infected individuals.
> 
> These investments, coupled with ASPR’s expertise, have advanced the two countermeasures through preclinical safety and efficacy and Phase I clinical trials.
> 
> Doses of the ChAd3-SUDV were shipped to Uganda in preparation for a ring vaccination study just prior to the end of the latest Sudan ebolavirus outbreak and both ChAd3-SUDV and ChAd3-MARV are currently in Phase 2 trials in Uganda and Kenya.
> 
> In partnership with the Rwanda Ministry of Health and international colleagues, ASPR has made an initial quantity of MBP-091 and ChAd3-MARV available in Rwanda to enable patient treatment and vaccination of contacts and healthcare workers.
> 
> Those investigational therapeutics and vaccines will be used under clinical trial protocols approved by Rwandan Regulatory and Ethics Authorities.

## HHS and USDA press briefing after California dairy worker bird flu cases

- **Source:** conference call
- **Attribution:** hosted by the Department of Health and Human Services
- **Date:** occurred October 4, 2024

> Nirav Shah, CDC [00:06:24]
> 
> Both individuals are dairy workers at two different dairy farms in California, both of which again are known to have cows that have tested positive. 
> 
> The state of California in conjunction with their local county health departments have been conducting active symptom monitoring of exposed workers on these farms. As a reminder, this is the process whereby individuals or farm owners report any symptoms, and then are followed up by public health officials at the state or the county level for things like testing, therapeutics, etc.
> 
> Health officials in California identified both of these cases through that process. Both individuals experienced mild symptoms, including conjunctivitis and neither reported respiratory symptoms. Neither individual was hospitalized. One individual reported that they thought that they might have had a fever. 
> 
> Both individuals were tested, offered antiviral treatment and are recovering. California is following up with potential close contacts. 
> 
> We are aware of household contacts who are also dairy workers and who have been contacted by county public health departments, or who will be contacted today. Thus, the public health investigation is very much underway at this time. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [00:17:46]
> 
> Serology is one tool public health leverages when we identify close contacts retrospectively, when they no longer have respiratory symptoms.
> 
> A flu serology test is done by drawing blood or sticking a patient's finger for a blood sample. 
> 
> Although some commercial laboratories can test for seasonal influenza A or B antibodies, there is rarely a clinical reason to conduct such testing.
> 
> Antibody tests for H5 are not commercially available. The CDC laboratory is an influenza WHO collaborating center and can perform serology testing of novel flu viruses in its BSL-3 labs. And we do this routinely. 
> 
> This test is not like other clinical serologies, which is a test a clinician would order for HIV or hepatitis B or C. It's a research test we use for surveillance that provides supportive evidence that someone was or was not infected with H5. 
> 
> Testing for an H5 antibody is more complex than the clinical serology that I listed above, requiring both the appropriate viruses needed to detect specific antibodies, and in many cases, high containment laboratories to perform the testing because the methods require working with infectious viruses. 
> 
> That means that it may take an additional two weeks for us to report the result of the seven serology specimens obtained from individuals in Missouri. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [00:19:10]
> 
> I will briefly walk you through the steps that CDC is taking to test these samples. 
> 
> As we previously reported, CDC was able to perform partial sequencing of the avian influenza H5 virus from the case in Missouri, despite a nearly undetectable level of viral RNA in the patient sample. 
> 
> This showed that the virus had two potentially important mutations, meaning two amino acid differences, in comparison with the virus is previously characterized during this event that could affectantigenicity.
> 
> Antigenicity is a property of being able to induce a specific immune response, such as creation of specific antibodies. So for serology testing, to be conclusive, it needs to be done using a virus that is genetically identical to the one obtained from the human case from Missouri or else there is a risk of a false negative test. 
> 
> Since this H5 virus was not recoverable, we could not grow it because there was not enough from the Missouri specimen, CDC needed to create the right virus for the test using reverse genetics to match the one from Missouri so that we can use it in these serology tests. 
> 
> This requires additional time and involves multiple steps. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [00:20:26]
> 
> So we've been working on this since we sequenced the virus from the Missouri patient in mid-September. 
> 
> It took about three weeks, to rescue the Missouri virus using reverse genetics, and complete the quality control steps that ensure we have the right virus.
> 
> This process will conclude by Monday and serology testing on the samples will begin.
> 
> At this point in time, CDC expects that conclusive serology testing results will be available in mid to late October. 
> 
> We realize people including all of us at CDC are anxious to see results from this testing. CDC is moving at a very accelerated pace while conducting rigorous science to assure the validity of these results.
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:22:59]
> 
> USDA has confirmed that the virus present in California is the B3.13 strain that was detected in the first three affected California premises and has been detected in dairy herds in other states. 
> 
> This is the same virus that we've been detecting in herd since the very beginning of the emergence of H5N1 in dairy cows back in March.
> 
> CDFA has been conducting a very thorough trace back, and the initial cluster of detections, that were noted, were found through this trace back activity.
> 
> Subsequently, CDFA has established a 10 kilometer zone around each of the affected dairies and begun testing bulk milk at the dairies in those zones, every week, for H5N1.
> 
> This bulk milk tank sampling has been the source of all of the recent detections that we've seen out of California. 
> 
> CDFA is also evaluating additional strategies for milk, collecting milk samples from unaffected areas that are not located in the surveillance zone, which may include utilizing state, federal regulatory animal health personnel, county, or state milk inspectors, or milk processors to give them a more comprehensive picture of the emergence of H5N1 in California. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:25:54]
> 
> As many of you may be aware, the state initiated a mandatory bulk milk testing program, in an effort to clear the virus from Colorado in July 2024, (inaudible) and it has proven to be very successful. 
> 
> The state's surveillance was in response to ongoing detections, in individual premise. Initially this revealed a significant local prevalence about 72% of dairies, centered in Weld county. 
> 
> Colorado has seen excellent compliance with the mandatory bulk milk testing. And right now we can report that there is only one positive herd, out of the state total of 86 herds that is currently affected by H5N1.
> 
> Mandatory surveillance in the state allows for continuous monitoring of herds and helps to detect any instances of non-negative results early on ensuring timely intervention. 
> 
> This decrease in the Colorado cases, even in the absence of a vaccine, gives us further confidence that H5N1 can be eliminated in the national herd, even in states where we have seen an initial rapid increase in cases. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Steve Grube, FDA [00:32:19]
> 
> Foremost, we wanted to address concerns from dairy producers that commercial milk processors might reject milk from dairy premises identified as having or possibly having H5N1 infections in their herds. 
> 
> We have received no reports that this has happened anywhere. But we wanted to emphasize that there's no reason for it to happen.
> 
> Left unaddressed, that concern could discourage robust participation in voluntary surveillance and sampling programs, which are critical to expand knowledge of the disease and inform programs to reduce H5N1 circulation. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [00:48:09] 
> 
> There have been extensive questionnaires that were conducted with this individual, and they included, sort of a review of food exposure. 
> 
> So again, no raw milk exposure. 
> 
> The individual did report using dairy and eating dairy, but we don't have anything that would implicate an immediate dairy exposure. 
> 
> Certainly not raw given the fact that they reported no raw milk exposure, but nothing that sort of directly implicates the dairy exposure at all.
> 
> Again, I think it's fair to say that we, despite a lot of work on Missouri's part, supported by us, in thorough investigation through survey, we have not been able to detect an animal or animal product exposure, based on that on those conversations.
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:55:19]
> 
> I actually don't think that it is out of place.
> 
> In those states that have had a really robust response and begun bulk milk testing very rapidly, I'd point to Colorado and Michigan in particular. 
> 
> We've seen a very rapid phase of initial detections, and a subsequent diminishment over time, sort of a long tail as the disease is eliminated from herds within the region. 
> 
> I think what we're doing now is seeing that very steep initial run up in detections caused by the state's very thorough testing program. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Steve Grube, FDA [00:56:32]
> 
> So as soon as we heard about this case, we worked with our state co-regulatory partners to identify any potential pasteurization failures in any state that supplied milk for Missouri and working with our partners, we found that there were no pasteurization failures in a recent timeframe, where it might be a reason for this person to be exposed. 
> 
> Again, there were no pasteurization failures in any states that were supplying dairy products to Missouri. 
> 
> And in addition, the amount of virus killed by pasteurization provides a many log order of magnitude safety barrier, safety margin, that ensures that the milk supply remains safe.

- **Date:** occurred October 2, 2024

> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:17:35]
> 
> We are wrapping up now the third round of experiments in BSL 3 facilities, in order to help us better understand how this disease manifests in animals, and how we can address it.
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:17:59]
> 
> I will mention that we are also sampling beef that is derived from culled dairy cows, through our national residue monitoring program, to make sure that we have as much visibility into H5N1 in the herd as possible. 
> 
> To date, we have detected no H5N1 in these samples, but out of an abundance of concern, both for public health, public safety, trading relationships and opportunities, we're going to continue to do this for the foreseeable future. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Eric Deeble, USDA [00:18:41]
> 
> A couple of things that folks often are interested in is the way in which this disease has spread and whether or not say the fall migration and birds moving back through the environment pose a risk to dairy cattle in the same way that they do to avian flock, typically poultry houses. 
> 
> And the answer is no. We have quite definitive evidence that H5N1 is spreading between states through cattle movement, which I mentioned earlier, and then spread between dairies, and sometimes, within dairies and sometimes to other dairies through the movements of individuals and equipment. 
> 
> We don't know everything that we would like to about this disease, and we're continuing to study it as vigorously as we can. We're particularly interested at this point at the manner in which the disease is transmitted from individual cow to individual. We know that it is not respiratory. We do know that it is associated with milk. We believe that milking equipment, and other environmental surfaces or milking practices are implicated, but it is challenging to get the definitive answer that we want, even as we continue to explore that we do know the best way to address that. 
> 
> And that is to make sure that folks understand the risk to their herd, and are able to implement biosecurity, in order to mitigate the risk of the spread. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Lizette Durand, CDC [00:39:30]
> 
> CDC is also collaborating with state health departments on H5N1 seroprevalence studies to determine if there is asymptomatic infection among people who have worked with sick cows.
> 
> Sero prevalence studies can help to answer important public health questions about whether there is evidence of asymptomatic infections and what behaviors are associated with greater or lower risk to infection. 
> 
> The Michigan health department released negative results from first round of data collection last month, additional data collection is ongoing. 
> 
> Colorado has completed enrollment in their study, and CDC is testing specimens in our lab. 
> 
> Additionally, a CDC team of epidemiologists, veterinarians and health communications specialists worked with the Ohio department of health to conduct a serosurvey that will assess past exposures to H5 viruses among a national network of veterinarians and other veterinary professionals. Next slide, please. 
> 
> As I mentioned on the previous slide, CDC collaborated with the Ohio department of health at the American Association of Bovine Practitioners or AABP annual conference to conduct a sero survey. 
> 
> The study enroll at about 150 attendees who have worked closely with cattle in the past three months.

## FDA spokesperson on OMOR sunscreen submission 

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Food and Drug Administration spokesperson Cherie Duvall-Jones
- **Date:** received October 2, 2024

> As DSM has publicly indicated, it has submitted an OMOR for bemotrizinol to the FDA. In general, after an OTC Monograph Order Request (OMOR) is submitted, the FDA will determine if the OMOR is acceptable for filing. If the FDA accepts the OMOR for filing, the FDA will review the OMOR. The FDA would then typically issue a proposed order addressing the substance of the OMOR within a timeframe agreed to under the OMUFA Goals Document. The public will have a minimum of 45 calendar days to submit comments on the proposed order (although FDA may provide for a longer comment period). After reviewing and considering the comments, the FDA would issue a final order, including to update the relevant OTC monograph(s), if appropriate. 
> 
> The FDA continues to encourage industry to submit data to address the data gaps for those monograph ingredients FDA has indicated need additional data. This will enable the FDA to confirm the ‘generally recognized as safe and effective’ status of these ingredients.
