# From President Trump at events

## November 6, 2024 in West Palm Beach, FL

> ([10;47;21](https://youtu.be/LS8amqeDbS8?t=38841)) These are fantastic people. And we can add a few names like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He came in. And he's going to help make America healthy again. And he's a great guy and he really means it. He wants to do some things and we're going to let him go to it. 
> 
> I just said, but "Bobby, leave the oil to me. We have more liquid gold, oil and gas, we have more liquid gold than any country in the world. More than Saudi Arabia. We have more than Russia. Bobby, stay away from the liquid gold. Other than that, go have a good time, Bobby.”

## October 27, 2024 in New York, NY

> ([1;49;48](https://youtu.be/jzAbz65GVAg?t=6588))  Robert F Kennedy cares more about human beings and health and the environment than anybody and he's going to be absolutely– having him is such a great honor.
> 
> I've been friends of his for a long time and I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines.
> 
> The only thing I don't think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet. I don't know Elon, he might not like liquid gold, it's oil and gas sometimes referred to as oil and gas. JD I think we're going to have to keep him away from the oil and gas what do you think? Howard, yes?
> 
> But where is Robert? He's around. He gave a beautiful speech, he's a great guy, he truly cares I mean– he truly cares about this, and it’s an honor.

## November 4, 2024 in Pittsburgh, PA

> ([1;32;25](https://youtu.be/AtZRWrDJwRM)) Bobby's going to like that. Bobby's great by the way. He's going to work and he's going to work with it but now he's going to work with Roberto Jr, Bobby Kennedy you know he's a incredible guy.
> 
> It’s not an easy step you know they've been Democrats a long time the Kennedy family I'm sure they were thrilled but Bobby had to do the right thing and he did and he's going to be very much involved. 
> 
> He’s got a tremendous view on health and pesticides and all the stuff and we're not really a healthy country look at some countries are much healthier than ours– than we are and they don't use all of this stuff and so Bobby's going to pretty much do what he wants I want him to do something really important for our country makes people healthier.
> 
> We have obesity, we have every problem you can have and Bobby feels very strongly about it and he's going to be very much.
> 
> The only thing I told him though: “Bobby you got to do one thing, do whatever you want, you just go ahead work on the pesticides, work on making women’s health.”
> 
> He's so into women’s health, and you know he's really unbelievable. It's such a passion. 
> 
> But I said, “Bobby I want you to do it, but leave the liquid gold to me. Don't– don't trample that–  don't trample on our liquid gold because we're going to let– we have more than any other country in the world by far, don't trample in that, Bobby let me just– just close your eyes, let me just make our country rich as hell.”
> 
> So I got to keep him away from that. That could be a problem but I got to keep him away.

> FDA’s war on public health is about to end. This includes its aggressive suppression of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, hyperbaric therapies, chelating compounds, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, vitamins, clean foods, sunshine, exercise, nutraceuticals and anything else that advances human health and can't be patented by Pharma. If you work for the FDA and are part of this corrupt system, I have two messages for you: 1. Preserve your records, and 2. Pack your bags.

> Fast Food is a part of American culture. But that doesn’t mean it has to be unhealthy, and that we can’t make better choices. Did you know that McDonald’s used to use beef tallow to make their fries from 1940 until phasing it out in favor of seed oils in 1990? This switch was made because saturated animal fats were thought to be unhealthy, but we have since discovered that seed oils are one of the driving causes of the obesity epidemic. Interestingly enough, this began to drastically rise around the same time fast food restaurants switched from beef tallow to seed oils in their fryers.
> 
> People who enjoy a burger with fries on a night out aren’t to blame, and Americans should have every right to eat out at a restaurant without being unknowingly poisoned by heavily subsidized seed oils. It’s time to Make Frying Oil Tallow Again 🇺🇸🍔

> The capacity for critical thinking has been so overwhelmed and subverted in my generation that they didn't see the possibility of an unprecedented level of control. They went along with COVID, which looked like in many ways a psyops program with orchestrated fear to disable the capacity for critical thought. Now, those same mechanisms are being used for them to support Kamala Harris.

> Neither Donald Trump nor myself are against IVF. Of course, we want couples to get the help they need to have a baby.
> 
> At the same time, we are going to investigate the alarming decline in fertility. We will evaluate research implicating chemicals like glyphosate, BPA, heavy metals, xenoestrogens, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and so on. We will look into nutritional factors too. Why are sperm counts declining year after year? Why are girls reaching puberty so early? Why are so many couples infertile? The American people deserve answers, and we will provide them. So yes, IVF — but this issue is so much bigger than IVF.

> 
> We have not yet decided exactly what that strategy is going to be, but that is a possibility. President Trump has given me three instructions. He wants the corruption and the conflicts out of the regulatory agencies. He wants to return the agencies to the gold standard empirically based, evidence-based science and medicine that they were once famous for. And he wants to end the chronic disease epidemic with measurable impacts on a diminishment of chronic disease within two years.

> You know, fluoride made sense in the 1940s when they put it in, but now we have fluoride in toothpaste. And countries like Austria and Germany that have removed fluoride from their water supplies have either the same or lower cavity issues than Americans. We don't need fluoride in our water, and it's a very bad way to deliver it because it's delivered it through the blood system.
> 
> …
> 
> I will work immediately on that. That will be one of my priorities, to make sure that Americans - of course, we're not going to take vaccines away from anybody. We are going to make sure that Americans have good information right now. The science on vaccine safety particularly has huge deficits, and we're going to make sure those scientific studies are done and that people can make informed choices about their vaccinations and their children's vaccinations.

> [00:04:30] At this point we are exploring a bunch of different structures that Trump administration and the Trump team has been very, very accommodating to give me what I want. 
> 
> And what I want to do is what President Trump asked me to do, which is three things. 
> 
> One to end the corruption and the corporate capture of these agencies, so that they're serving public health interests rather than the mercantile interests of the pharmaceutical companies. 
> 
> Number two, to restore the tradition in these agencies of gold standard, empirically based evidence-based science and medicine that they had when I was a kid that they were world famous for and that they lost. 
> 
> And then third, to end the chronic disease epidemic, and which now disables 60% of our kids. When my uncle was president, it was 6% and it's costing us 4.3 trillion dollars a year, and 77% of American kids cannot qualify for military service. 
> 
> This is an existential threat. It is five times the military budget. And he's asked me, he's asked me to have measurable results within two years.
> 
> …
> 
> [00:06:07] We don't know what I'm going to do. I talked to the president about it yesterday and I-- and he asked me what I wanted and I said, we're developing a proposal now. 
> 
> So I-- I'm not sure whether that's going to be the most effective. I want to be in the White House and he's assured me that I'm going to have that, but that may-- I want to be in the position where I'm most effective to end the chronic disease epidemic. And I'm confident that if I wanted to do HHS secretary, the president would fight like hell to make that happen.

> [00:08:25] President Trump called me on August 23rd, immediately after his shooting at Butler, he called me three hours later on the telephone. And he asked me to meet with him the next day in Milwaukee. 
> 
> And we had a two and a half hour meeting then and a number of subsequent meetings. And during those meetings, he urged me to unify our parties and to work with him, to reclaim the values that Robert Kennedy stood for, that John Kennedy stood for. 
> 
> He said he wanted to end the forever wars and bring that 200 billion that we've sent to the Ukraine home to rebuild America. He told me that he wanted to end the censorship and end the surveillance and the propaganda. And that he wanted to end, put an end to the weaponization of law enforcement agencies against the American political system. 
> 
> And that he wanted to end this corrupt merger of state and corporate power that has turned our regulatory agencies predatory against the American public. 
> 
> And he said, that he wanted to make America healthy again. And end the chronic disease epidemic that is destroying our children. And that is an existential threat to our nation. 
> 
> When my uncle was president and I was a 10 year old boy, the rate of chronic disease in this country was 6%. Today it is 60%. 
> 
> When my uncle was president, we spent zero on chronic disease in this country. There were no drugs to treat it. Today, we spend $4.3 trillion.
> 
> …
> 
> [00:11:05] It is destroying us morally because we are betraying our children by letting these industries poison them. 
> 
> The rate of obesity at that time was 3%. Today, it's 50% in our children and it-- 74% of Americans are obese, or overweight. 
> 
> We didn't suddenly become lazy and glutinous. We are being mass poisoned by corrupt industry.
> 
> …
> 
> [00:12:07] 77% of American kids are no longer qualified for military service because of chronic
>  disease diagnoses. And what are these diseases? 
> 
> They are obesity, they're neurodevelopment disorders, and I'm going to list some of them because I'm a 70 year old man. And when I was a boy, I never heard of any of these diseases, because nobody had them. 
> 
> I had 11 siblings. I had about 74 cousins. And I didn't know anybody with ADD, ADHD, speech delay, language delay, sleep disorders, Tourette's syndrome, narcolepsy, ASD, or autism. 
> 
> The autism rate in my generation today in a 70 year old man is one in 10,000. The autism rate in our children is one in 34, in California, as Calley just said, it is one in 24. And the rate in boys is much higher. 
> 
> We also saw this explosion of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease and lupus and juvenile diabetes, all of these exotic diseases that we never heard of as a kid.
> 
> The diabetes rate when I was a kid was effectively zero. A typical pediatrician, when I was a young boy, would see one case of diabetes in his lifetime, in his career, a 40 or 50 year career today, one out of every three children who walked through his office door is diabetic or prediabetic. 
> 
> And nobody's talking about it. Nobody's saying anything. Nobody is recognizing that we are being mass poisoned by big pharma and big food. 
> 
> And all these allergic diseases that suddenly appeared. I never knew a kid anywhere in any of the schools that I went to that had a peanut allergy or food allergies or eczema. My brother had asthma and he was told by his doctor, there will never be a cure for asthma because it's so rare that nobody will ever study it.
> 
> Today, one out of every eight black children in America's cities has asthma. What is happening to our children? 
> 
> And I saw this happening and I began writing about it. And the media rose up and silenced me in 2005. And nobody would talk about it. The doctors wouldn't talk about it. The pediatricians wouldn't talk about it. The scientists, the government officials and people warn me, if you keep talking about this, you're going to destroy your career. And I was stunned by this. 
> 
> …
> 
> [00:15:30] And I-- and my prayer is this. 
> 
> I asked God for 19 years to put me in a position where I could end the chronic disease epidemic and bring health back to our children. 
> 
> And in August, God sent me Donald Trump.
> 
> …
> 
> [00:19:37] As soon as Donald Trump started talking about giving me the power, he asked me to

> 
> He asked me to root out the corruption and end the conflicts of interest in our regulatory agencies. And end this corporate capture that has turned our regulatory agencies into sock puppets of the industries they're supposed to regulate. 
> 
> And he asked me to restore the tradition of gold standard, empirically based evidence based science in medicine, in our regulatory agencies, and to restore the transparency so that these agencies have to must stop hiding science from us when it clashes with the commercial ambitions of the pharmaceutical industry. 
> 
> And he doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country. You ought to know the risks and benefits of everything you take. And we need good science for that. And we need informed consent. And he asked me to do that. 
> 
> And then he asked me to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country. And he said, I want to see results, measurable results in the diminishment of chronic disease within two years. 
> 
> And I said, Mr. President, I will do that. 
> 
> …
> 
> [00:24:09] The most valuable asset in America is a sick child. They don't want your child dead. They want them sick for life. Then he is dependent on their products and every, and the more statins they prescribe for heart disease, the more heart disease goes up. The more metaformin they prescribe for diabetes, the more diabetes we have. The more antidepressants they prescribe, the more people we have who are depressed. The more Ambien they describe, the more insomnia there is. The more opioids they prescribe, the more pain there is. The more Viagra they prescribe, the higher ED goes. 
> 
> And so these drugs, their formula is pharmaceutical paradigm is not working. And President Trump wants to do something different.

> There there's only two countries in the world that allow pharmaceutical advertising on the airways. One of them is New Zealand and the other is us, and we have the highest disease rate and we buy more drugs and they're more expensive than anywhere in the world.

> [00:11:15] I'd say that what we don't really need at HHS is more medical expertise. What we need is an expertise on decoupling the agency from institutional corruption. And-- because it's the corruption that has distorted the science and this science that has distorted the recommendations and the recommendations that have distorted the health impacts that have ended up with America having the sickest population in the history of the world.

And what I will do is first of all, end the tyranny of Medicare, for example, if you're diagnosed with diabetes, Medicare will only allow your doctor to give you Ozempic or Metformin.

> Our job should not be to dictate outcomes or clinical guidelines in terms of, you can only take this drug. It's the only intervention that it's allowed. We should be giving the best science to scientists all over this country, and then telling Medicaid, whatever, to doctors all over this country, whatever that doctor recommends and Medicaid is gonna pay for it. 
> 
> So if Medicaid says that, if a doctor's patient has diabetes or obesity, the doctor ought to be able to say, I'm going to recommend gym membership, and I'm going to recommend, good food and Medicaid ought to be able to finance those things the same as they would Ozempic. 
> 
> …
> 
> [00:17:27] There is a slight silo, but it's not exclusive silos. And he's given me essentially a portfolio to, that is across the portfolio to all the agencies. So I'll be looking at the military and the intelligence apparatus and, you know, a lot of other agencies.
> 
> …
> 
> [00:19:49] The system is designed to ensconce industry, the mercantile ambitions of these industries ahead of public health. 
> 
> So it's designed to get you to leave you no choice but to eat bad food. And it does this mainly through a system of subsidies that then makes that food the cheapest and most highly subsidized and the most available, particularly in poor neighborhoods
> 
> …
> 
> [00:20:24] And deprive the public of the appropriate knowledge. So we're not allowed to label GMOs for example, and tell the public you're eating GMO's. 
> 
> You may not like to eat GMOs for, for variety of reasons that the GMOs themselves may have problems because they're untested and they're strong indications that they alone, can cause health impacts, but almost all GMOs and particularly corn, which is corn and soy, which are the big and wheat, those crops are saturated with pesticides. And the GMO is usually Roundup ready. It's a genetic alteration that has been instilled in that crop and the corn is resistant to the pesticide Roundup so that planes can fly over the corn fields and saturate the entire environment with Roundup. 
> 
> And the only green thing that will ever grow there is GMO corn is what they call Roundup ready corn. So the whole premise of that crop is that it's going to increase pesticides in our food. 
> 
> And so here is how the subsidies work. And you're not allowed to know about a lot of these things, because you're not, the labeling of GMOs has essentially been illegalized, but there subsidies the hundreds of billions of dollars given in crop subsidies, the crop subsidies are mainly for those three crops. And those three crops, soy wheat and corn are the feed stock for the processed food industry. So they make those very, very cheap, almost free. 
> 
> And therefore they can give you the illusion of cheap food. So there's a subsidy there. And then the food stamps, 70% of the food stamp program is for processed foods, 10% of food stamps go to sugar drinks. And this is giving us the diabetes epidemic and the obesity epidemic and then school lunch programs also about 70% of those are for processed foods. Kids are raised on those foods. 
> 
> …
> 
> [00:24:31] We have a thousand ingredients in our food that are illegal in Europe. 
> 
> If you look at, for example, fruit loops, which was the top of the food pyramid, that's the other thing is they also also bought the panels and make recommendations for food and, and clinical guidelines for medicine. 
> 
> So they're all conflict of interest with the food industry and the farm industry and fruit loops in this country contain red dye, yellow dye, blue dye, all these dyes, all of them grow tumors, all of them cause neurological impacts, particularly ADHD with are very, very well documented. And those dyes are illegal in Europe and Canada. 
> 
> Kelloggs makes, sells fruit loops in Canada and Europe, but the fruit loops in those countries don't contain any of those chemicals. They contain vegetable dyes, which are much safer. 
> 
> So the same company that is poisoning us and knows they're poisoning us is making the same product across the border that is not so poisoned and in Europe. And so, and they have captured the agencies. They've captured Congress. They've captured the press because they're the biggest advertisers, farm and food. And, and they're brainwashing us. 
> 
> And then of course, they're, starting when kids are little with the food stamp program and with this advertising, Tony, the tiger, et cetera, the same way the tobacco industry did. And they're addicting kids to sugar or FDA now recommends that two year olds get processed sugar every day. This is criminal.
> 
> …
> 
> [00:27:02] What we need to do is change the panel. So they're making good recommendations and they're telling people don't eat these foods. And now is that going to solve the problem? No, because the processed foods, the cheapest in particularly in poor neighborhoods, they're the only pro-- I work a lot in Bedford Stuyvesant restoration in New York in Brooklyn was one of the poorest, uh, neighborhoods in the country and the nearest grocery store, when I started working, there was 75 blocks and three different buses. 
> 
> And so very, very difficult for a mother who wants to take care of her children and make good choices. She really can't do it. And she doesn't have access. 
> 
> If you're asking me, I'm not a doctor and I don't make health recommendations for people, but I can tell you what I do. And I've done for many years. And he gave me this advice many years ago and I took it and it was quite easy for me, which is never eat anything in a package. So I don't need anything in a package. And then I do other stuff as well. 
> 
> …
> 
> [00:28:06] I do grow some of it, but I don't grow much. And most people it's, it's kind of irrelevant what I do because most people don't have access to the resources I have. And if you live in Bed-Stuy, you just don't have the ability to grow your own food. 
> 
> So we need to change number one, the government recommendations. 
> 
> We need to start forcing these companies to internalize their costs. So the illusion of cheap food goes away, right? 
> 
> Because if you're drinking Coke and it seems cheap and it gives you diabetes over the long run, that's not very cheap. Right? And you get on Ozempic, which is costing us $1,500 a month. Well, you know, that's not cheap food. It's the illusion of cheap food and it's seductive, right? 
> 
> But it's a perverse incentive. That's incentivizing Americans. They injure themselves. And of course, food and pharma want that because for them, the most profitable asset in our country is a sick child. They don't wanna kill our children. They want them sick for life and dependent on pharmaceutical interventions.
> 
> …
> 
> [01:13:16] I think fluoride is a poison. 
> 
> My son was saying this, my son was in hazardous waste industry and he had to take an exam and that if a fluoride truck crashes on the highway, they have to clear the highway for miles around and people come in and Tyvek suits and respirators and gloves to do the cleanup. 
> 
> And you know, it is, it's a toxic ingredient, it's a toxic byproduct of the certain chemical process and oil industry process. And for many years, those industries, it was causing them thousands of dollars per drum to get rid of them. And then they came up with the idea why don't we put it in the water supply? And they did that and it causes cancers. 
> 
> Of course it causes your bones to deteriorate and it causes severe IQ loss. And last week, a group that I'm associated with won a seven year lawsuit against EPA, on fluoride that I think will result in the fluoride being removed from all the water supplies in this country. 
> 
> The simple answer is I don't like it.

> [01:05:35] Now the big problem is not those chemicals. 
> 
> The big single problem is agency corruption. 
> 
> The agencies are controlled by the industries they're supposed to regulate. And that, the result is that the most valuable asset for the pharmaceutical industry and for the medical cartel, for hospitals, for the insurance companies, the most valuable asset is a sick child. They don't want to kill our children. 
> 
> They want to keep them sick, their entire lives with chronic disease that make them permanent consumers, these very, very expensive products. And instead of protecting our health and our food supply, the government agencies are instead operating to advance the mercantile interest of the pharmaceutical industry of food industry and big ag. 
> 
> And they've allowed them to dictate these policies that are killing us. 
> 
> …
> 
> [01:08:44] David Brownstein, who you mentioned is my personal doctor. So when I need medical treatment, when my kids need medical treatment, I come to a doctor in Michigan to get it. So-- and Dr. David Brownstein treated thousands of patients and didn't lose a single patient during COVID because he was actually treating them to heal them. 
> 
> And doctors like him all over the country were being penalized, marginalized, vilified, demonized for doing the things that he was doing. And, you know, I want to thank him. I want to thank you for your courage for standing up because most doctors will not do that. 
> 
> And the reason for that 15 years ago, 80% of the doctors in this country were independent and 20% were corporate part of corporate systems today, 80% are part of corporate systems and they're terrified because they're going, they have to pay these enormous medical school bills. And if their employer fires them, they're bankrupt and they don't have a profession. 
> 
> So they oftentimes keep their mouth shut and they do what they're told. And they, that's one of the contributors in this country to this terrible crisis we had. 
> 
> …
> 
> [01:11:45] I've said for 20 years that I'm not anti-vaccine. I've never been anti-vaccine. What I've said is we should have the same kind of rigorous testing for vaccines as we have for other medications. And that if somebody, you know, all medications make some subset, smaller subset of people sick, oh that have different bad reactions. 
> 
> Instead of saying that doesn't exist, we need to acknowledge that and we need to care for those people. And we need to figure out ways to stop that damage. 
> 
> The problem is vaccines are-- have an exemption from pre-licensing safety testing. So vaccines are tested for efficacy. So does the vaccine avert chickenpox? Does it avert measles? That's all they test for. 
> 
> They don't do the other part. Is it safe over the long term? Are you, is it a product that is more likely to cause problems or to avert them? And that kind of testing is done for every other medication through what they call double blind placebo controlled trials. And the only medication that is exempt from that are medical devices and vaccines. 
> 
> The reason for that is because the vaccine program was initially launched by the public health service, which is the predecessor agency for CDC. The public health service is one of the five uniform military services. So it is a military agency. That's why it has surge generals and people with military ranks. 
> 
> And the vaccine program was launched as a national security defense against biological attacks in our country during the cold war. The government wanted to make sure that if the Russians attacked us with anthrax or some other biological agent, we could quickly deploy-- could quickly develop and deploy a new vaccine to 200 million Americans without regulatory impediments. 
> 
> If they called it a medicine, they'd have to go to five to eight years of placebo control trials. So they said we can't afford to do that. We got to instead, we're going to rename vaccines biologics, and we will exempt biologics from pre licensing safety trials. 
> 
> Today, when I was a kid, there were three vaccines required, which I complied with. For my kids, it was 72 vaccines, and not one of them has ever been tested in a prelicensing safety trial.
> 
> …
> 
> [01:14:25] What I'm focused on is the bigger issue of chronic disease. And that is linked to the vaccine schedule in some cases, the explosion of chronic disease, but the biggest culprit is our food. 
> 
> And what we need to do is end the corruption at the health agencies and at USDA, and so FDA, CDC, NIH, and the other agencies need to have every nutritional scientist in those agencies should be fired on day one. 
> 
> They're not doing nutrition. You can't give Americans a food pyramid that advises them what to eat, and the top thing, the food pyramid is fruit loops. That is corruption. That is not science.
> 
> …
> 
> [01:16:39] It's not just PFOA and PFAS, it's the pesticides. We have atrazine in now, which is second highest used pesticide in 63% of our water supply, including here in Michigan. Atrazine is not only carcinogenic, but it is a very-- it's a neurotoxin, a very potent endocrine disruptor, which means it developed-- it is linked to sexual development problems. 
> 
> And I'll give you just one of the studies. There was, there's an African American, very famous, brilliant African American scientist named Tyler Hayes at UC Berkeley. He puts 70 frogs, African water frogs in an aquarium, all male frogs. He put atrazine in that aquarium at the levels that EPA considers safe and that occur in water supplies all over our country. 60 of the 70 frogs became sterile. 10% of the frogs male frogs turned female and produced fertile eggs because of the atrazine. 
> 
> Now, if you were the head of NIH and you saw that, what you would say is we need to do more studies. We need to study in mammal models and ultimately human models to see if this is affecting sexual development, our kids and fertility in our kids.
> 
> Right now, children in this country have teenagers have 50% of the testosterone that they had two generations ago. They have 50% of it to sperm count. They had two years ago, or two generations ago, girls in this country are reaching puberty at lower ages than any girls in the world.
> 
> So girls, you have eight year old girls reaching puberty. The average is 10 to 13. In 1900, it was six years older. There's no country in Europe. We have a lower puberty rate for girls than any nation in the world. And we have bigger fertility problems than any nation in the world. And ultimately this is existential for our people. 
> 
> And we have to recognize is a national health emergency. And I'm going to urge President Trump on day one to do the same thing they did in COVID, which is to declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease. Because that's what's really killing us and threatening our country.
> 
> …
> 
> [01:29:05] We need to end the corruption. 50% of FDA's budget comes not from the taxpayer, but from the pharmaceutical industry. And, USDA is completely dominated by big ag, these giant companies. So it's all about corruption ultimately, and they're-- and by the way, these industries have not just corrupted these agencies, they've corrupted all the medical schools through these same payments, they've corrupted, the NGO's, like the American Diabetes Association receives the bulk of its money from these big food manufacturers. And from Coca-Cola.
> 
> Coca-Cola donates millions of dollars to the NAACP, in order to persuade the NAACP that any time people say, like me say, let's get the sodas, 10% of food stamps are used by for sugar drinks for Coca-Cola. And other drinks is this crazy. And the food industry fights this by paying the NAACP to say, if you criticize Coca-Cola in the food in the school lunch program, in the SNAP program, you are racist. 
> 
> …
> 
> [01:31:02] 90% of farm subsidies, like crop insurance and others go to these big GMO crops and monoculture crops only about two to 3% go to vegetables. 
> 
> So, you know, we're, we spend, we give eight times the amount of money to subsidize tobacco, as we do to do all fruits and vegetables in this country, we have our priorities messed up.
> 
> And it's about corruption. So we, you know, the kids shouldn't be eating grains. They shouldn't be eating grains and they should definitely not be eating seed oils. And they, for sureshould not be eating sugar. And yet that is what we're forcing them to eat.
> 
> …
> 
> [01:35:26] We don't need to be doing it this way, or we need to make sure that if farmers who are addicted to those kind of crutch GMO crops have a incentive, an economic incentive so they can make the choice to do something different. 
> 
> We're not going to force anybody to do anything, but we're gonna start changing the incentives so that organic agriculture becomes very, very attractive to farmers.
> 
> …
> 
> [01:44:02] The way they do that, they actually are incentivized to keep our population sick. 
> 
> And if you look at the deals that they have with these hospitals, oftentimes they they're incentivizing the hospitals to do things that are actually damaging to human health and very, very -- and discouraging procedures that could actually save people. So, you know, I think those are all problems that are very large problems. 
> 
> My problem with fixing this is that, you know, it's very, very difficult to fix the healthcare system, the actual system that's because of you have to go through Congress. And what I did when I was running for president is all of my policies were things that I could do through policy changes, personnel changes and through executive orders. Because I tried not to make any promise that I couldn't keep and anything that goes through Congress, I just stay away from because I have no confidence I'm going to fix it. 
> 
> That I have no confidence that I can do that in either four years or eight years, because Congress itself is owned by these industries, by the medical cartel, by the pharmaceutical industry. 
> 
> And in fact, when you look at it, all of the arguments about whether it should be Obamacare or single payer or double payer or all of these issues that the Democrats and Republicans live and die for, they're all about moving deck chairs around on the Titanic because the ship is sinking and the ship is sinking because we're paying $4.3 trillion for chronic disease. 
> 
> And because of that, we pay for example, typically about three or four times per capita, what Europeans pay. In Italy, we pay four times what Italians play per capita and Italians live 7.4 years longer than us. 
> 
> We used to have the longest life expectancy. Today, we're six years behind Europe on average and we're sinking every year, but we pay more for medical care for healthcare than any country in the world. And we have the worst health outcomes. And the reason for that is because our health agencies are run by the pharmaceutical companies and by the big food companies, rather than medical people who are trying to heal.
> 
> …
> 
> [01:48:01] I didn't like Donald Trump as a president. He did a lot of things that I disagreed with. He put an oil lobbyist in charge of the interior department. He put a coal lobbyist in charge of EPA. He put pharmaceutical lobbyist in charge of HHS. He put Scott Gotlieb, a business partner of Pfizer in charge of the FDA who then went, did a hundred billion favor for Pfizer, and then went back to Pfizer's board and collected his payoff. He put a telecom guy in charge of FCC and so on. So, you know, this was like, to me, you're saying, you're gonna drain the swamp, but you actually are creating all these swamp creatures. 
> 
> And, but this time I had all-- at President Trump called me three hours after he was shot in Butler. And, we had a long conversation with each other and it was very friendly. And he said, I want to work together with you. And I said, let's meet. And we met the next day for about two and a half hours in Minneapolis. And we had an extraordinary conversation for me because I, he was proposing that we unify our parties. And we agree that if we did that, that he would still be able to criticize me on issues on which we would continue to disagree. And I would be able to continue to criticize him. 
> 
> But the three issues that he was extraordinarily conversant on, which surprised me was one of the issues that were the very issues that I joined the race to, to, to address one was ending the Ukraine war and the, and ending the domination, the military industrial complex and the neocons of U.S. foreign policy. And I was surprised about the antipathy, very, very fervent antipathy that he had toward the neocons. And he had appointed John Bolton, head of NSA, a who was a neo-con. So I was surprised about this. 
> 
> He on public health, on ending the chronic disease epidemic, he was with me. And, and on ending the censorship and surveillance and what he said to me at that time, as he said, the last time I came in here in 2016 and I was unprepared to govern and I didn't even expect really to be elected. And all of a sudden, I was surrounded by hundreds of big corporations who were saying, you got to appoint this guy, this guy. And he said, I did it. And they were bad people, and I'm not going to do that again.

And that President Trump, he said, a lot of people might surprise me to see this, but to say, hear me say this, but he has chosen exactly the only person who can do this: Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

> [00:44:00] If it followed national trends, there should be about 2,200 with autism in the Amish communities. It's one in every 34 kids-- we've gone from one in 10,000 to one in every 34 kids, according to CDC, one in 22 kids in California. He went and did a study in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. And, they were able to find only three kids in the Amish community who had autism. And all three of them were people who were children who had been adopted by the Amish after receiving their vaccines. 
> 
> This doesn't mean vaccines is the only cause of autism they're-- they're-- our kids today are swimming around a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods that operate along the same biological pathways. But some of it's coming from pharmaceutical drugs, some of it's coming from, most of it's coming from our food and we're poisoning our kids as you pointed out. 
> 
> But anyway, he was only able to find three. And none of them among, you know, among Amish who were not adopted. 
> 
> So that's a-- it's not, again, it's not a peer reviewed study, but it is something that many, many people have observed in these populations that do not expose themselves to pharmaceutical drugs, to pharmaceutical interventions and to poisoned food.
> 
> …
> 
> [00:58:04] I have two kids who've lived in Italy and one of my sons had eczema from when he was little. And I'm sure I know where that came from, but it was, but he had, he had bad eczema. 
> 
> And when he ate any kind of pasta in this country, he would get these terrible, terrible outbreaks, you know, really agonizing. And he moved to Italy and he lived off of pasta for a year and a half and he never get a case. 
> 
> And then as soon as he comes back here and he eats the pasta in this country, he gets eczema again, and you know, they don't have the glyphosate like we do that is sprayed on the wheat at harvest time. So it's going right into the food. And, like I said, there's a thousand ingredients that are now used in our country that are banned in Europe. The food in this country is just poison. 
> 
> And you asked me what I would recommend to people? 
> 
> I'm not a doctor or a nutritionist, but somebody told me years ago, a rule of thumb that I've lived with for many years, which is never eat packaged food. If it, if that's the easiest thing to do. If it comes in a package, don't eat it. But you can look at the ingredients. I look at the ingredients now. 
> 
> Almost everything that we eat contains really bad poison, high fructose corn syrup, all kinds of dye, red dye, yellow dye, blue dye, they're all poison, red dye is directly associated with ADHD. There are a study after study that shows if you take kids off a red dye, the ADHD diminishes significantly, and many kids disappears. 
> 
> We also know diabetes can be treated with food. Diabetes is a treatable condition and you put somebody on an all meat diet and 60% of the diabetes case go away. And I, and other, the other diabetes case that don't go away completely are, are diminished dramatically.

> 
> Because although they're starving, they don't have chronic disease, but today, black Americans suffer more from diabetes, more from cardiac illnesses, more from obesity, and chronic disease and any other demographic, because so many Blacks are living in food deserts and they can't afford to go to Whole Foods. 
> 
> If you pointed out, poor Americans live 15 years less, shorter lives than rich Americans, we're literally poisoning them to death and giving them these miserable tortured lives of being devastated by chronic disease. And, but talk and because of that, they had the highest death rate from COVID because people who died from COVID according to CDC, the Americans who died from COVID had an average of 3.8 chronic diseases. 
> 
> That's why we had the highest, one of the reasons we had the highest COVID death rate on earth of any country. 
> 
> …
> 
> [00:33:09] We did an analysis that showed that-- I'm most alarmed by pediatricians because, I grew up with 11 siblings. I had something like 71st cousins on both sides of my family. And, I never saw a chronic disease when I was growing up. I never saw my classmates. I never saw my friends. 
> 
> And, so when I started seeing all these kids now appearing suddenly with autism, which I'd never heard of as a kid, I was raised on the spear tip of the movement for rights, for people with intellectual disabilities. 
> 
> I worked in special Olympics from before it was founded from when it was still camp Shriver. My aunt founded it, my cousin, Anthony Shriver founded, best buddies. I worked for 200 hours in a home for the retarded, when I was in high school, I never saw kids with autism. 
> 
> And then suddenly they started appearing in the mid 1990s. And then now it's, we went from one in 10,000 to one in 34. We saw food allergies suddenly appear at the same time. I never know anybody with a peanut allergy or right. They're in every classroom now, autoimmune disease, like rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile diabetes, ADD, all these neurological diseases suddenly just exploded in the mid nineties. 
> 
> And, the why? Pediatricians, about 50% of a typical pediatrician's office comes from funding comes from vaccines.
> 
> And it's not just from giving this shot, but it's also from, and this is something you point out, from the guaranteed traffic. Because when I was a kid, I went to a pediatrician when I needed stitches. Right? Which was fairly often. 
> 
> But, that's the only time I went, that's the only time I went. And, but today, those that traffic is guaranteed. Because they have to come in, 10 wellness visits and that makes up a huge part of they're incentivized by the insurance companies. They're given huge bonuses if they make sure that every kid is vaccinated. 
> 
> And I have to think that, I don't want to say pediatricians are mercenary, because I think almost all pediatricians get into that job because they love children and they wanna help.
> 
> But they're so blind to what's happening to this generation of kids. And none of them seem to ask the basic questions that I was asking, what the heck is happening to our children?
> 
> …
> 
> [00:38:48] I will declare a state of emergency when I get in there. And because we need to act dramatically to make sure that this is over and it's causing us 4.3 trillion dollars a year, that's bankrupting us. We're destroying our country. It's existential. 
> 
> As you said, when my uncle was president 6% of the GDP went to healthcare today it's 22%. And it's almost three times our military budget and we're the sickest country in the world.
