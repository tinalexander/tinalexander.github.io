> Evelyn Twentyman, CDC [00:02:54]
> 
> As you probably know, CDC just recently this past fall launched the CDC Bridge Access Program for COVID 19 vaccines. This is a very exciting short term solution to provide continued access for adults to free COVID 19 vaccination, regardless of their insurance status. 
> 
> However, it's called the Bridge Access Program for a reason, and it must be a bridge to somewhere that's somewhere. And I'll agree with Peschin, we can agree on the name later, but that somewhere needs to be vaccines for adults, vaccines for all, or a program that will really complement what we've already done with vaccines for children and our 317 program, to bring vaccines to all people, regardless of their insurance status.
> 
> A comprehensive immunization program, like the kind I'm talking about that addresses needs from childhood through adulthood is a cornerstone of maintaining optimal health, as well as for preparing for any public health emergency that might come our way. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Evelyn Twentyman, CDC [00:23:05]
> 
> So through this sort of complement of availability, we've been able to reach quite a few adults. We've had about 1.2 million vaccines out the door through this program thus far, and are just hoping for ever more every day. 
> 
> I do want to speak to one really, really, really important limitation of the bridge-- actually, I'll go ahead and add in a second, two critical limitations. 
> 
> One, it is only COVID 19 vaccine. I know I'm preaching to the choir here, so I won't talk about that too long. But COVID 19 vaccine is not the only vaccine that adults are recommended to receive. And so this is not the comprehensive program that we need. It's not the comprehensive infrastructure that we need to provide equitable immunization, across the spectrum of needed vaccines. That's the first really important critical limitation. 
> 
> The second is a sustainability. The bridge access program will end by December 2024. That is this year. So we have part of one more vaccine season left to go. 
> 
> We are of course working to see if there's any way that we can extend this, but as it now stands, this will end. This was meant to be a temporary bridge to a more permanent solution like VFA. And I do hope that we get there.
> 
> ...
> 
> Evelyn Twentyman, CDC [00:45:54]
> 
> Long term care facilities are largely filled with patients that have insurance. And so in theory, they're not the target of the Bridge Access Program. In theory, they wouldn't be part of VFA, but VFA would benefit them. And I'll tell you, this is why we've been working so hard to enroll long term care facilities under eTrueNorth in the Bridge Access Program. 
> 
> Because exactly like Peschin said, many of these facilities are staffed largely by uninsured adults. And again, viruses don't respect borders. They don't respect station either. 
> 
> Like whether you're a patient or a provider, you're equally likely to get a virus. And I know that the care providers for these patients in long-term care facilities certainly don't want to be the person that their patient caught flu from or caught COVID from.

## FDA spokesperson on questions related to shortage of ADHD medications

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Food and Drug Administration spokesperson Chanapa Tantibanchachai
- **Date:** received February 7, 2024

> **How often does FDA ask drugmakers for updates of availability of these ADHD drugs in shortage?**
> 
> The FDA regularly works with manufacturers to evaluate the entire supply chain of drug products to help prevent or reduce the impact of a drug shortage. For a drug in shortage, we are continuous contact with the manufacturers to get the latest info and we update our website daily.
> 
> **How is FDA calculating total national historical demand, to decide that they are still in shortage?**
> 
> The FDA receives information provided by manufacturers regarding their ability to supply the market, as well as market sales data on the specific products, then lists drugs on its shortages website once it has confirmed that overall market demand is not being met by the manufacturers of the product. The FDA does not consider a product to be in shortage if one or more manufacturers are able to fully supply market demand for the product.

- **Date:** received February 6, 2024

> Thank you for reaching out to us on this important matter. Apotex strives to meet the demands of our patients and enable access to affordable generic medicines. The production limit on the drug’s active ingredient is one of the main drivers for our inability to fully supply the market. We have not been able to obtain enough raw material to commercialize the product at full commercial scale, and we have used our full quota for calendar year 2023.

- **Date:** received February 1, 2024

> After several weeks of declining flu activity indicators, some CDC surveillance systems have shown increases in parts of the country in recent weeks. It is not unusual for there to be a slight increase in activity during the weeks following holidays. During some seasons this is the start of a second wave of activity; in other seasons, it is a slight increase in activity prior to activity decreasing toward the spring. CDC is closely monitoring activity and will continue to provide weekly updates via FluView.

## CDC clinician outreach call regarding influenza

> Tim Uyeki, CDC [00:02:49]
> 
> I'm going to summarize influenza activity this season and cover disease burden. Next slide. 
> 
> So this slide shows influenza positive tests that are reported to CDC from clinical laboratories throughout the U.S. it's by a weekly basis, as of a week ago. 
> 
> And what you can see from the slide is that, although the numbers of positive tests peaked at the very end of the year, there's still a substantial amount of influenza activity occurring in the U.S.
> 
> From public health laboratory testing, we know that the majority of influenza viruses circulating this season in the U.S. are influenza A viruses and of those, the vast majority have been influenza A H1N1 pdm09 viruses, with a smaller proportion of H3N2 viruses and overall influenza B viruses have been circulating, but to a much lower extent. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Tim Uyeki, CDC [00:09:22]
> 
> So in terms of estimated disease burden, what you see on the upper right figure is 12 influenza seasons. It excludes data from the 2020 to 2021 season where we saw very, very little influenza activity in the U.S. and actually worldwide because of probably because of non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented to control the COVID 19 pandemic, but a wide range of disease severity from season to season. 
> 
> We see seasonal epidemics that result in estimated deaths of about 5,000 to about 52,000 per season, and then hospitalizations wide range for anywhere from estimated a hundred thousand to 710,000 in a more severe season. About 9.4 to 41 million illnesses occurring. 
> 
> And you can see from the top figure on the right that, among those 12 seasons, the most severe we had was during the 2017-2018 influenza epidemic in the U.S., which is the higher range of 710,000 estimated hospitalizations and 52,000 estimated deaths.
> 
> For this season, preliminary estimates as of January 20th, and we'll update these regularly as we have data, estimated 18 to 35 million illnesses have occurred anywhere from 8.4 to 16 million medical visits, 210,000 to 440,000 hospitalizations and 13,000 to 38,000 deaths. 
> 
> So based on these data, we would classify the season to date as a moderate season in terms of disease severity. There's much more influenza still to go, although nationally we have peaked. 
> 
> And just to say that, although I showed that hospitalization rates are highest in people 65 years and older, mortality rates are also much, much skewed towards people 65 years and older, they're much higher the older you are above 65 years old. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Tim Uyeki, CDC [00:36:12]
> 
> So just as a reminder, as I mentioned, although the influenza season has peaked nationally, there's still a lot of influenza viruses circulating throughout the U.S. A lot of communities are still influenza. We do expect influenza activity to continue for many weeks to come this season. 
> 
> So for unvaccinated people, I want to remind clinicians and public health colleagues that vaccination is the most effective way to protect patients against influenza.

> 
> Action Item:
> 
> • Please review the recall notice (FSCA 5812) for the BIOFIRE® FILMARRAY® Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel.
> 
> • In cases where a positive Norovirus result appears inconsistent with clinical presentation, please refer the specimen to your send out reference lab for confirmation using alternative detection methods.
> 
> • If the confirmation result is discrepant from initial result using the BioFire, report the findings directly to bioMerieux technical support team at biofiresupport@biomerieux.com or via telephone by dialing 1-800-735-6544 and selecting option 5 for Product Technical Support. 
> 
> Background:
> 
> Norovirus is the leading causes of vomiting and diarrhea from acute gastroenteritis with most Norovirus outbreaks in the US occurring in November to April. The CDC, along with other state Public Health Laboratories (PHL) including MDH PHL, have expressed concerns regarding an unusual surge in Norovirus positivity detected by the BIOFIRE®, coupled with a low concordance rate observed with alternative detection methods. On 1/29/24 bioMerieux released a recall notice for the BIOFIRE® FILMARRAY® GI Panel, necessitating appropriate follow-up actions.
