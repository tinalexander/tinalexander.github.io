> CDC is aware that California has identified a presumptive positive influenza A (H5) case in a child. CDC is supporting the investigation by the California Department of Public Health and is awaiting the specimen to test at its lab for confirmation and will provide further updates promptly.  

Yes, that is correct – the child and their family members tested positive for the same, more common respiratory viruses that are not bird flu.

## CDC spokesperson on Mycoplasma pneumoniae trends

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson Jasmine Reed
- **Date:** received November 18, 2024

> August remains the peak for the percentage of pneumonia-associated emergency department visits with a Mycoplasma pneumoniae diagnosis. As shown in the figure on Mycoplasma pneumoniae Infection Surveillance and Trends | M. pneumoniae | CDC, these diagnoses dropped a little after August, but remained high through early November. Of note, diagnoses among 0–1-year-olds have steadily increased throughout the fall without any subsequent decrease.
> 
> Though we have seen an increase in every region, the highest levels are in HHS Regions 2, 6, and 7, while the lowest are in HHS regions 8, 9, and 10. It’s important to note that while the National Syndromic Surveillance Program collects data from the vast majority of emergency departments, it isn’t 100%, so there may be regions of the country with more or less reporting. CDC will continue to monitor the situation.

> Is it known how H5N1 was introduced to the flock that was confirmed this month?
> 
> **No, it is not known. However, wild bird introduction is possible.**
> 
> For example, wondering if any links have been identified to imports or travel.
> 
> **No, no link has been made to importation or travel. (FYI – Hawai‘i has strict importing regulations for birds and other animals, including cattle)**
> 
> Also, are you able to say if multiple herds or flocks have been identified infected with H5N1 in Hawaii, or only one?
> 
> **There is only one confirmed site and investigations are ongoing.**

> Robert Redfield [00:00:13]
> 
> I'm probably one of the biggest advocates for vaccine. You mentioned that I, when I was CDC director, I would say that I think vaccines are the greatest gift for science to modern medicine. And I still believe that.
> 
> Kennedy's not, anti-vaccine. What Kennedy is about is transparency about vaccine, honest discussion about vaccines, asking for the data to show that these vaccines are safe and they are efficacious.
> 
> And the mere question of asking what's the data for safety, many of his detractors say, okay, well, you're, anti-vax.
> 
> No, just show me the safety data. Show me the efficacy data. 
> 
> I have high confidence that Kennedy is going to be a strong supporter of, of transparency on vaccines and when the vaccine data shows that they're efficacious and a benefit to the American public, he will promote them.
> 
> ...
> 
> [00:01:36] We need transformational change.
> 
> Right now, we've created over the last 20, 30 years, we've developed a disease system. We need to make a health system. 
> 
> And when Kennedy says he wants to help make America healthy again, when I was CDC director, one of the challenges was we lost about 1.2 million people died of COVID.
> 
> Other countries like Taiwan lost less than 10,000 people. Why did we lose so many people? 
> 
> We lost so many people is cuz we're because (crosstalk) we're a sick nation.
> 
> And Kennedy is really committed to making us healthy again. 
> 
> And I do agree with you. We should all get behind him. Making a healthy America is not a partisan issue.

>  
> _Is there any more recent totals available? If not, are you able to share an estimate for when those are expected to be released?_
> 
> ...
> 
> I checked with our experts, and it sounds like those are expected to be released by late winter 2025.

- **Date:** received November 15, 2024

> "There's no question that we need a pro-life HHS secretary, and of course, we have concerns about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. I believe that no matter who is HHS secretary, baseline policies set by President Trump during his first term will be re-established."

> Sen. Susan Collins [7;55]
> 
> Well, you know, I am a member of the HELP committee, the Health Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, we have partial jurisdiction over the Secretary of Health and Human Services, so we will be holding a hearing on Mr. Kennedy's nomination. 
> 
> The committee that actually votes on it and will also hold a hearing is the Senate Finance Committee, so I anticipate having ample opportunity to question him and learn more about his views.
> 
> That department is a huge, very complex department with a lot of different programs, and I will be talking to him about that and his managerial experience, as well as about some of the views that he reportedly holds. 
> 
> So I'm not worried about not having enough information or enough time, because in that case, I actually am on the committee that has partial jurisdiction.
> 
> Question [9;04]
> 
> Are you worried about some of the views he has?
> 
> Sen. Susan Collins [9;11]

> You know, I want to hear directly from him, because I've never met him, so all I have are press reports.

## Americans United for Life statement on Trump picking Kennedy

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Americans United for Life
- **Date:** received November 15, 2024

> John Mize, CEO of Americans United for Life:
> 
> "Like many newcomers to the conservative pro-life movement, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. needs further education on the reality of abortion and its harmful effects on children, women, public health, and our nation. We are optimistic about working with RFK Jr. to correct the wrongs of the Biden/Harris Administration. I find his statement at the Iowa State Fair in August to be encouraging. This man had thought through the issue and drew a line at 15 weeks, much further towards conception than any of his Democrat political colleagues ever would. I hope RFK Jr. shows a clear sign to the pro-life movement that he is aware of this devastating threat to American children to encourage support of his nomination. Showing his desire to re-instate REMS, basic safety measures on the abortion pill, would be a large signal to the movement.”

> Another one who's another great mind, and a great guy, and so popular, and I think he's right, he wants to make people healthy. It's driven him pretty wild over the last number of years.
> 
> And the Democrats didn't treat him well. He was doing fantastically well, and I think they came out with some rule that you had to do this Mike, you had to get 70 or 75% of the vote to qualify to be in the primary. That was a pretty tough thing to get.
> 
> And he was doing incredibly well and he decided he can't do it, went independent, now he's with us all the way. And today I nominated him for, I guess, if you like health, and if you like people that live a long time, it's the most important position: RFK Jr.
> 
> Bobby? Good.
> 
> And I just looked at the news reports. People like you Bobby. Don't get too popular Bobby. You know, you've reached about the level. No.
> 
> We want you to come up with things and ideas and what you've been talking about for a long time. And I think you're going to do some unbelievable thing.
> 
> Nobody is going to be able to do it like you, and boy does he feel it in his heart. So congratulations also, to your family.

## CDC spokesperson on COVID-19 vaccination survey

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson
- **Date:** received November 13, 2024

> There have been no methodological changes from last year to this year. One thing to note is COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the 2024-25 season was earlier then last season for the updated 2023-24 COVID-19 vaccination. This earlier start could likely be the leading reason for the higher coverage in all age groups at this time compared to similar calendar time last season. We will continue to track vaccination data as we continue through the season.

> Peter Marks, FDA [00:22:16]
> 
> If we end up having to spend a lot of time, re-litigating things that we know work, like prophylactic vaccines, it will take away from the time that we have to help push innovation of very novel products. 
> 
> So I think that's the-- I think where we have to, or this has been a problem in the United States that's been around for the past years, since-- it was there before the COVID 19 pandemic. And it has only grown in place, this doubt about vaccine safety and effectiveness of vaccines. 
> 
> And hopefully we'll be able to clear up some of the misinformation over the next years.
> 
> ...
> 
> Peter Marks, FDA [00:32:57]
> 
> I think we're going to continue to work-- we are public health professionals. We're here.
> 
> In some ways I think, I don't mean to have a strange analogy, but much like the Department of Defense, we're the Department of Defense against pathogens that are coming around, people-- we are going to have to stand guard, and that doesn't matter who's in the White House because, I hate to tell you, the bird flu for those-- is now in a lot of different species, including cows, which are big, it's replicating. And it's just a matter of time before we see more breakout and potentially something that could be either epidemic or pandemic potential, whether it's this year, next year or the year after. So we have to be prepared for that. 
> 
> We have to have, keep our heads about us, and I think we'll get support, hopefully. And I think we found working, we managed to get by, by keeping our eye on public health, and drowning out a lot of the noise. So, that's what we'll have to do here. 
> 
> It's my one reason why I just hope we can keep vaccine confidence up, because it would be, if we do have another epidemic, it would be really nice not to lose lives unnecessarily like we did during COVID 19, from people who didn't take vaccines, who, because they had false impressions of what they were about. 
> 
> So I think our, our goal is focus on public health, get the work done, and I think we've, best analogy is if we can go through and be kind of stealth below the radar screen, get the public health mission done and only pop up above the radar, into the radar zone when we need to.

>

> 
> Question [00:36:44]
> 
> From where you sit. And when you talk about conspiracy theories and so forth, is there a positive spin on unleashing RFK on the FDA?
> 
> Peter Marks, FDA [00:36:56]
> 
> Positive spin?
> 
> So I guess it's how you react to a challenge and we'd be very happy to have lots of public advisory committees, where there are experts who-- that will speak. And hopefully that would be returned, at the return favor that we would ask, is that someone keep an open mind to the fact that vaccines might actually work and might not be dangerous. 
> 
> So I think we are open minded. I think that could be-- look we at FDA want, are trying to lean in as much as we can. We have a group of devoted public servants. 
> 
> I think, we can be asked to respond to a lot of different incoming that are not our typical incoming. 
> 
> The only thing I would ask from anyone is to just do it with respect, because just as I think at CMS, we have now up to 20,000 people in FDA, 1,500 in my center, 6,000 in the center for drugs, who are so devoted to what they do. And they do what they do to protect the American people. Not because they're trying to, not for any kind of nefarious purpose. 
> 
> So they, and during the COVID pandemic, people worked 14 hours a day to move those vaccines along. So there's a lot of devotion there. So hopefully we can have a dialog that is a civil one.
> 
> ...
> 
> Peter Marks, FDA [01:01:46]
> 
> So I sat in the room with Mr. Kennedy before on the issues of vaccines multiple times now.
> 
> I think there's this great opportunity if he focuses on chronic diseases and on health. I think his concept of doing things about our, what we do with foods, and what we do with things, you don't need GLP one inhibitors, if you don't actually have weight problems to start with, because you have good diet and exercise, perhaps. And if he takes an approach towards that perhaps, very supportive.
> 
> I think as we, as he comes towards FDA, I think we'll be looking to have-- we'll engage-- happy, we'll have to engage with a dialog with him and see.
> 
> I just would ask-- what I would ask of him is that he keep an open mind. We're happy to try to show as much of the data as we can. And I think the data are essentially overwhelming, in certain areas, but we'll just have to-- we'll just have to engage in the dialog. 
> 
> And perhaps engaging in that dialog, especially if it's in a public venue, it may help, it may help bring some of the rest of the country along because sometimes as somebody is convinced, perhaps, maybe some of the rest of the country will be convinced of the utility of vaccines.
> 
> Remember vaccines also help chronic conditions. If you look at people who get influenza vaccinated, and COVID vaccinated, they have a lower risk of heart attacks, et cetera. 
> 
> So, basic public health measures, we'll do what we can to interact with Mr. Kennedy to try to help make sure that those get delivered to patients. 
> 
> It's been good. You know, vaccines have been good since about, we've known that they're worthwhile since about 17 something. So it's probably a-- and George Washington wanted to virulate his troops. So they've been around for a little while.
> 
> ...
> 
> Peter Marks, FDA [01:03:42]
> 
> If he wanted to engage I'm-- we're open, he knows where-- he probably knows where to find me.
> 
> ...
> 
> Peter Marks, FDA [01:03:56]
> 
> In terms of the safety of the safety of vaccines. We've tried to do that pretty actively with our CDC colleagues, and people are free to go to our websites, but I'm happy to have anyone contact me. We're happy to-- we're happy to try to provide as much information as we can, because there again, there's no secret files. 
> 
> I mean, if there's secret, they're-- you know, I hold a security clearance. If they are secret from me then, so they must be at some other level of classification. 
> 
> But as far as I know, all the data we have indicate that the vaccines that we have licensed in the United States are safe and effective.
> 
> ...
> 
> Peter Marks, FDA [01:04:53]
> 
> I think I would say something that I'll say-- I'm going to try to try to be very fair.
> 
> There are doctors with MDs and there are PhDs. Okay? I can tell you that PhDs are able to dive down to a level of understanding of science, perhaps that MDs, some MDs, can't.
> 
> I think he has an understanding of science that perhaps does not-- it's not as deep as others might, but I think what, I would just ask him more than anything else, rather than, because I know a number of attorneys who know more than most PhDs and MDs about medicine. So it doesn't, it's not the degree. 
> 
> It's just a matter of keeping an open mind.
> 
> ...
> 
> Peter Marks, FDA [01:08:08]
> 
> Look, the people who I work with absolutely are committed to what we do in terms of protecting the health of Americans and-- so yes, I do want to keep my job and I do want to make sure, because I think we have a team together that has been put together that can help protect.
> 
> We've been through-- we have a team now that's been through a pandemic. We managed to respond to the mpox epidemic remarkably rapidly. And it did not become greater than it was in part because we were able to respond so well because we had done it before.
> 
> Emergency use authorizations were issued in a matter of weeks instead of months because of how well people did it. 
> 
> So I think you have a group of people that are there very committed to public health because they feel a commitment to the individual people in the country, not to politicians, but to what it means to mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, to have the best possible state of public health in this country.

## NIDA's Nora Volkow on drug overdose deaths

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** National Institute on Drug Abuse Director Dr. Nora Volkow
- **Date:** received November 13, 2024

> The declines in estimated overdose deaths that we have continued to see in these recent data are unprecedented, robust, and appear to be reflecting real trends. These data give us hope that we may finally be making significant progress in reducing the devastating loss of life from the overdose crisis.
> 
> While these data are cause for optimism, we must not lose sight of the fact that nearly 100,000 people are still estimated to be dying annually from drug overdose in the U.S. Each death represents a tragic loss that could have been prevented. It’s also important to acknowledge that progress has not been equal for all groups. Unfortunately, for the most affected groups, namely Native Americans and Black American men, the death rates are not decreasing and are at the highest recorded levels.
> 
> Understanding the causes for the different trends in overdose mortality is needed to tailor implementation and support of evidence-based strategies to prevent and reduce deaths. We must continue to prioritize efforts to prevent drug use, treat addiction, provide access to lifesaving harm reduction services, and support people in recovery that are equitable and accessible to everyone who would benefit from them.

## CDC spokesperson on H5 case in Canada

- **Source** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson
- **Date:** received November 13, 2024

> An individual has been hospitalized at British Columbia Children’s Hospital diagnosed with presumptive positive influenza A(H5). This is the only presumed influenza A(H5) illness among humans identified in Canada. CDC has been in touch with Canadian health authorities and expects to learn more as Canadian health authorities acquire additional information. Contact the Public Health Agency of Canada for the most up to date information on this potential case.  
> 
> Influenza A(H5N1) has been detected recently in poultry, wild birds, and mammals in British Columbia. Ongoing outbreaks of influenza A(H5) have been detected globally in animals. Sporadic cases are not surprising; nevertheless, CDC continues to work vigilantly to monitor worldwide H5N1 activity.
> 
> The risk to the U.S. general public continues to be low. People with exposure to infected animals, including birds and dairy cows, are at higher risk.

> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:01:20]
> 
> What I've been sharing with my team is that an election happened, but our mission hasn't changed one bit. 
> 
> CDC exists to protect health and improve lives. We're going to stay focused on that mission. And folks want fundamentally, I believe, want their families to be safe, want their families to be healthy. 
> 
> And we need an entity like the CDC, as well as our larger public health ecosystem, to protect folks health every day. And we've been working hard to be a different CDC. We are. 
> 
> Four years has been really important for the CDC to learn some very important lessons and we've taken action on those. And so I've told our team stay focused on the things that we have been prioritizing, making sure we are ready to respond to any health threat coming our way. 
> 
> We prioritized improving mental health in reaction to exactly what we were seeing in those polls, and supporting young families and making sure we're preventing, and not just reacting to those health threats.
> 
> ...
> 
> [00:05:41] Fundamentally folks want to make sure that we have an entity that is ready to respond to health threats. And that means we need data infrastructure to be able to identify those things, have the people who are talented to understand how to respond. 
> 
> But I do think that there, Rob said it well, there is a difference between understanding the evidence and the data and policy choices. And I think particularly when we look at resources, I think that is where I'm most concerned, because this kind of work and that infrastructure takes resources and you need to maintain it. 
> 
> Now we already knew we were going to hit a bit of a cliff in the next coming year to two years as COVID funding goes away. And so there was already going to be a choice, but I am concerned when I see proposed budgets out there that zero out our ability to work on overdoses and suicide. 
> 
> What do you think is killing people under the age of 50, top reason? It is unintended injury, right? Which is a combination of suicide, overdoses, car accidents. 
> 
> And for children, the number one thing that is killing our children is drowning, right? So if, if we are drowning, our young kids, right, two to five, right? 
> 
> So if-- we have to work on those issues, we need the data and the evidence and the investment in those areas. But the good news is in the last four years, we've been making progress on overdose. 
> 
> And actually you're going to see some new data from the CDC today, um, about overdoses and continued progress in that space. 
> 
> We've had our first reductions in fatal overdoses that we have seen. 
> 
> And we need to keep progress on that. 
> 
> So we, we are concerned again about having those ongoing resources to do this important work, to highlight the problems and the challenges, and then bring the evidence to solve those challenges.
> 
> ...
> 
> [00:08:03] So it is a real trend and that's great. Look, we are throwing a lot at this, and we are starting to really break through, I think with some important things.
> 
> One, we know connecting folks to care at a moment of a non-fatal overdose is really critical, right? Because folks have had a major life event happen. They've almost lost their lives. It is the important time to connect them to care. We're using way more peer supports to do that. 
> 
> We have-- we are much more, talking much more about fentanyl, and making sure that folks understand that fentanyl could be in things that you don't think fentanyl could be in. 
> 
> And so using things like fentanyl test strips, that is a common, common language in our high schools, unfortunately we had to be there. 
> 
> So those are the kinds of ways in which we are highlighting it. I mean, and this work has been going on for years.
> 
> ...
> 
> [00:10:13] As you were saying in the United States, at least those cases had been quite mild, reassuring, but as we were seeing around the world, when we see other cases of avian, it has been more severe. 
> 
> And so this case in Canada that came over the weekend, we have some  more work to do to understand the strain of the virus. 
> 
> It is our presumption that it potentially is from one of wild birds. It may look more like some of the avian flu cases we see often in Southeast Asia, that tend to be more severe, but we don't know that until we can do the genetic analysis. 
> 
> But what we want to make sure again, how do we think about any of these potential pandemic threats is making sure we have the infrastructure ready to go, to be able to detect, to prevent and to respond, right? And so we have a very extensive network of flu surveillance across the country. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:14:20]
> 
> We have heard a lot about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. potentially taking some kind of czar like role over health agencies. You know, he tweeted in March that he wants to clean up the cesspool of corruption at CDC and forced the public health agencies to come clean about COVID vaccines. 
> 
> He's also said that he wants to require there to be long term placebo controlled trials run on all childhood vaccines recommended by the CDC. 
> 
> What is your message to people working in public health about how to respond to that kind of language?
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:14:55]
> 
> You know, I think we have a very short memory of what it is like to hold a child who has been paralyzed with polio or to comfort a mom who has lost their kid from measles, and it's not that many generations ago, but it is a far enough away that folks have forgotten.

> And we need to remember that the reason we have these childhood vaccines is to make sure that we are the strongest, the healthiest, that we can be as a community. 
> 
> And I don't want to have to see us go backwards in order to remind ourselves that vaccines work. Like they work, they protect our kids, they are our best  defense against these terrible illnesses that luckily we haven't seen, but we are starting to see around the world, because vaccine rates post pandemic are lower. 
> 
> We're seeing more measles cases. Again, measles is one of the most contagious viruses out there. It's the canary in the coal mine for vaccination rates. We're seeing more measles cases here in the United States, but luckily more than 90% of our, of our communities are vaccinated that protects us.
> 
>  But remember that vaccines are-- only work well when we are all getting to that. We've heard those terms, herd immunity, when we're all in this together, because we know that some of some folks whose immune systems don't work as well as others, their vaccines are not going to protect them. So they don't have the kinds of choices that some of us do have. 
> 
> So we, I think the important part in this moment is to remember, to make sure that we're focused as Dr. Califf said on the evidence, and that we stay focused on what works to protect the health of communities. 
> 
> No one wants to see a child paralyzed, a child die from something that we can prevent.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:16:52]
> 
> And how do you respond to sort of charges that there are these tropes of hidden data that the CDC has not released about vaccine safety?
> 
> Mandy Cohen, CDC [00:16:59]
> 
> You know, look, CDC has been incredibly transparent with information and data, and I'm really proud of that, of that transparency. 
> 
> And so, we want to make sure folks feel reassured about vaccine effectiveness, about vaccine safety. And I think that's what folks are going to continue, continue to see.

## BC CDC's Bonnie Henry at press conference

> [00:00:57] This person was admitted to the BC children's hospital late on Friday, and over the weekend, their condition had varied and sadly, they right now remain in critical condition.
> 
> ...
> 
> [00:05:51] That has been our priority, the contact tracing over the past few days to make sure that there are not other cases out there that we're missing, to make sure that people who have been in contact with this young person during their infectious period are assessed, are tested. And, all of the people who've been in contact either at home or in the hospital are notified. 
> 
> So we've been following up. We, and I say that the team at Fraser Health Public Health at the BC CDC, BC children's hospital BCH, have been working together over these last few days to ensure that all family, friends and contacts have been identified in the community, that our public health teams are following up with healthcare workers as well, that have been in contact with this young person. 
> 
> And we would have tested a number in the vicinity of three dozen people for influenza to make sure that there's no hidden or asymptomatic or mild infections out there. And people have been offered prophylaxis with an antiviral medication called oseltamivir to, prevent them from developing symptoms, should they be infected.
> 
> And we'll be following up the public health teams who will contact people daily for 10 days from their last exposure. 
> 
> That is one of the reasons why I have confidence that we at at this point have not identified anybody else that is sick with this virus in British Columbia right now. 
> 
> ...
> 
> [00:08:35] We're very grateful again, to the family of this young person who at the same time they're caring for and supporting their loved one have been very generous in sharing information with us as best they can, and being committed with us to finding out how this happened. 
> 
> Having said that, I must caution that there is a very real possibility, we may not ever determine a source, but at this point we have a number of leads that we're following, and we will be tracking down everyone.
> 
> ...
> 
> [00:14:46] As I mentioned in BC, we're in our sixth wave of high pathogenic AI from H5N1, and it's affecting now, as of this morning, 26 premises across British Columbia, primarily in the lower mainland Fraser valley area. And this is aligned with migratory waterfowl, so geese and ducks that migrate from the north and they fly south at this time of year and then back north again in the spring. 
> 
> So back to our investigation, we are looking very, very carefully at all potential animal exposures, bird exposures. There were other pets in the house, and there was contacts with pets in other houses.
> 
> Right now, we have no specific source identified, but the testing is ongoing in partnerships with our veterinary colleagues and will be continuing that investigation very thoroughly. 
> 
> I will also say there has been no link to any of the infected poultry premises here in British Columbia. So that's not where we seem to have a source, related to this case, as I mentioned, an environmental source is also something that we need to investigate thoroughly, although it's less likely. 
> 
> ...
> 
> [00:22:54] Their initial symptoms started, not surprisingly with conjunctivitis, so infection in the eyes, fever and cough. And those are really the hallmarks. 
> 
> It's very difficult early on to determine if that is from influenza from COVID from other respiratory viruses. 
> 
> So it really was the surveillance network that we have in place and the testing that was done that led us to identifying the H5 in this person.
> 
> ...
> 
> [00:26:48] So there were a variety of animals that had been in contact, in different settings, including dogs, cats, some reptiles, no birds that were aware of. 
> 
> So those are the ongoing investigation that were, that the public health teams and the veterinary teams are doing together. 
> 
> There was one one animal, a dog that was sick and advanced testing has been done on that animal. And so far, all of the tests that have been done on the animal so far have been negative. 
> 
> So we've not yet identified a source, but that is absolutely an ongoing investigation.
> 
> ...
> 
> [00:36:59] This person does not live on a farm and there is no contact with any poultry farming or any other farming, in the-- their area, or in the family. 
> 
> So there's no obvious quick connection to a farm or exposure to wild birds or to poultry that we can detect at this time. 
> 
> ...
> 
> [00:41:47] As you can imagine, things have progressed and the clinical condition can change very rapidly. But, they're experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome. 
> 
> ...
> 
> [00:42:52] So yes, we have a lot of people working back and forth across-- moving back and forth across the borders. 
> 
> In this case. However, there was no-- this person did not have any contact with-- did not cross the border. Did not have any contact with farms or ill animals in Washington state.
> 
> ...
> 
> [00:44:28] This was a healthy teenager, prior to this, so no underlying conditions, and it just reminds us that in young people, this is a virus that can progress, and cause quite severe illness.
> 
> And the deterioration, as I mentioned was quite rapid. So the person, I mentioned that this symptoms started on November 2nd. But they had not been in school. 
> 
> There were definitely people that they were in contact with during the infectious period, but they were not in school during their infectious period for a variety of reasons. 
> 
> And no there's been no travel in any of the contacts, any of the family or friends, outside of the country-- I shouldn't say that-- to Vietnam or other areas in Southeast Asia in the last little while.
> 
> ...
> 
> [00:49:09] And we know as I mentioned that young people in Vietnam and China and other places also are more likely to have severe illness with this virus. So that tells us that something about our immunity as we get older, seems to protect us from getting those deep lung infections that cause the more serious illness.
> 
> One of the hypotheses that I think there's some evidence for is that as we get older, we have more exposure to the N1, particularly since 2009 where we've had an H1N1 circulating every year. 
> 
> So whether we have exposure to that, N1, confers some protection either from vaccination or from previous infections that we accumulate some better protection for those more serious infections from that, from having that history of vaccination or infection that you just don't have the time to accumulate, if you're a young person. 
> 
> So that's a hypothesis. I think we don't really know why mostly it's a milder infection while mostly in older people, especially adults, and why it doesn't transmit thankfully very easily between people.

> Robert F. Kennedy Jr [00:02:20]
> 
> The stuff that he is really, like, bad.
> 
> It's not-- campaign food is always bad, but the food that goes on to that airplane is like just poison. 
> 
> It's all-- you have a choice between-- you don't have the choice. You're either given KFC or a Big Mac. That's the big-- that's like when you're lucky. 
> 
> And then the rest of the stuff, is I consider kind of inedible, but I was eating it. 
> 
> And then he eats Diet Coke, I saw it, I was with Dana White the other day, and who was really good, great for my campaign. He was a huge, huge supporter. 
> 
> He's very close to Trump. They've had a relationship for 20 years for, you know, through UFC. 
> 
> He said during that time, sometimes he'll sit through a fight with Trump, and he's five hours in the fight, said he has never seen Trump drink a glass of water.
> 
> Question [00:03:34]
> 
> Yeah, exactly, just like sodas or Diet Coke or whatever?
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr [00:03:39]
> 
> On diet coke.
> 
> But he has this extraordinary energy.
> 
> ...
> 
> Bobby Kennedy [00:22:11]
> 
> I've seen that now, again and again, with Trump, during the transition where we make all these suggestions about who should be at each post, he comes into the meeting, and he very quickly, we have-- there's eight giant screens and each person has a picture of themselves on the screen. They have a biography next to 'em. You can press a button and you can see three different clips from that person. 
> 
> So you can see how he talks and how he presents himself. He or she. And he goes through them very, very quickly. 
> 
> And then he says, I want that guy. And-- and he's making the decisions. He listens to what people say, but he makes the decisions. And he has very, very firm ideas. And he decides very quickly, and the meetings are very quick when he comes in. 
> 
> And it really-- you know, Elon Musk is in the room. Amaryllis, my daughter-in-law is in the room, and a few other people, and they all have very strong ideas. These are all alpha people. And they're, you know, they have very strong ideas about what should happen, but he makes those decisions. He makes it very quickly. 
> 
> I've seen a level of decisiveness, a real vision. And the interesting thing about him is he doesn't care what that person believes. The person, there's a very big sympathy among all of his advisors that we should stay away from the neocons. 
> 
> But if he puts a neocon up there, you shouldn't worry about it because the decision ultimately is going to come from him. 
> 
> And he said to me, at one point, he said he really hates John Bolton. John Bolton was his NSA advisor. 
> 
> And he said, but it was good that I had him there because it scared the shit out of everybody in the world at, if I had John Bolton there, John Bolton wants to bomb at every country in the world. 
> 
> And he said, they believe that I was gonna do it too. So it was good for me to have him there. And so that's the way he thinks about things. 
> 
> He doesn't care what you believe. He doesn't care what your ideology is. He's going to make this decision himself. 
> 
> And I've been so impressed with that. It's completely changed my opinion of who he is, and really convinced me that this guy that I had such contempt for such disdain for is actually, you know, a really extraordinary leader that he could be one of the great presidents in history.
> 
> ...
> 
> Calley Means [00:37:19]
> 
> I think President Trump, with his team of Bobby Kennedy, Tulsi Gabbard, Elon Musk, you know, on down the list, have a mandate from everyone here, a mandate from voters to kick the special interest in the deep state, out of the office and really drive foundational change. 
> 
> So I think what we can all do is just maintain that and continue to just speak out support President Trump and support him in what he wants to do and what he's promised to do, which is true transformational change, not partisan change, but true foundational change.
> 
> When it comes to MAHA, and I'll just be real quick here, and Bobby obviously will have much more to add, but we've talked about three things, cleaning up corruption. 
> 
> What can we do? The FDA is 75% funded by pharma, the USDA nutrition guidelines, which set guidelines for our children, 19 out of the 20 advisors are funded by food or pharma companies. The NIH is an orgy of corruption where 88,000 grants in recent years have gone to conflicted researchers. 
> 
> That ties to number two, the gold standard, just this isn't about any agenda. It's just understanding what's happening. 
> 
> We have AI, we have so many smart people. We should be open sourcing all the data. We should be fearlessly understanding why people are getting sick. We should let the data data guide us to where it goes. We should not be covering up for any previous guidance. 
> 
> We basically need to say a lot of guidance on pharmaceutical products, on food, on what we've been giving our children might be wrong. We need to have fearless data. That's all we're asking for. 
> 
> And you can do that very quickly.
> 
> And then just end the chronic disease epidemic and what Bobby's talked about and what President Trump has talked about. In the Republican platform, it says, we believe in chronic disease reversal and benefit flexibility. 
> 
> We are not telling anyone what drugs to take, what food to eat, what to do, but the $4.5 trillion of medical system right now is top down, it's mandates. 
> 
> When you are a child on Medicaid, who's a little bit sad, you got a 15 minute appointment, you're getting a pill, SSRI. If you have high cholesterol, 15 minute appointment, you're getting a pill, statin on down the list. Now they're pushing Ozempic on 12 year olds. 
> 
> The mom, that mom on Medicaid should have flexibility to go to health coaching, to go to nutrition, to go to more functional methods. 
> 
> Just giving patients the choice, if we can get the science, right, and then let patients make their own decisions, Americans aren't trying to kill themselves. 
> 
> They want their kids to be healthy. That's the foundation of the policies we're putting together.
> 
> ...
> 
> Bobby Kennedy [00:40:03]
> 
> There is a lot of science that suggests that mental health is deeply connected to the food intake. 
> 
> There's a very, very good study that shows that children who are insulin resistant at age nine are five times, four, five times more likely to have a psychotic episode before they're 24. There's another very, very strong study that shows that kids who become obese during puberty are four times more likely to suffer severe depression, by the time that they're 22 years old. 
> 
> And, there's a dispute about whether the depression is come coming from the social demotion that you get from being obese and fat shaming or whatever, but it is really an irrelevant dispute. If you are overweight, you're more likely to be depressed. 
> 
> There's a recent study of epidemiological study of 300,000 people that shows a very, very strong link between depression and-- people who eat processed food every day are three times more likely just to experience clinical depression and people who don't eat it every day, in other words, not people who are eating organic food all the time, but just people who don't eat every day, less than every day. 
> 
> And then there's a series of pilot studies. And normally I wouldn't quote because they're not strong science, but they're indicative, and they should be mentioned that diseases like anorexia actually disappear. You lose your diagnosises by treating them with diet with keto diets and other kind of diets. 
> 
> And those are the studies that NIH should be doing. 
> 
> NIH won't do those studies because they don't want to know the source or the cure or the treatment for chronic disease. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Calley Means [00:48:21]
> 
> I can't look at my phone without 20 messages from reporters, writing stories about how this man is gonna be dangerous to public health. 
> 
> Public health, we are on the verge of collapse. Like we, we are destroying our children's future right now. 
> 
> And there are evil forces trying to protect that because it is the largest and most profitable industry and the fastest growing industry in the country is healthcare. And it profits from children being sick.
> 
> And success, one big level of success, and what we can all do in this room is we can stand up to these forces and change consciousness to where we all, a lot of people in this room see it, we can't go back. We must change the incentives. We must change it to where we, we stop just poisoning and then drugging kids at scale and start asking what they're eating. Start asking what they're putting in their body. Start asking about environmental factors and start, people are saying, this is gonna be bad for farmers. 
> 
> We want farmers to be at the center of healthcare. In the United States, we spend two times less per capita. We spend half the amount per capita on food as they do in Europe, but they spend three to four times less per capita on healthcare in Europe, they live 5, 6 years longer. Like they're, they've got something going right there. They're not poisoning their population and then cleaning up the mess. 
> 
> Like, that's the level we're on. This can happen quickly if we all stay on that consciousness level and really help Bobby and help President Trump stay high level and not get lost in the weeds. 
> 
> Like we just need to change our paradigm of how we think about these things.
> 
> ...
> 
> Calley Means [00:52:46]
> 
> It's so simple, but if we have a obesity and diabetes crisis and among six year olds, maybe it's not working to drug them. 
> 
> Maybe doctors should be recommending dietary interventions. Maybe we should be incentivizing exercise. You can do that from the medical system. 
> 
> If you get the standards of care, and frankly, a lot of this is bureaucratic. It's not even statutory. You don't even need Congress. 
> 
> The-- we have outsourced billing codes and Medicare, Medicaid to the AMA, which is a lobbying group for pharma. And they outsourced to medical groups like the American Diabetes Associaton, American Academy of Pediatrics, that are literally pharma front groups. 
> 
> And there's not a word in American Academy of Pediatrics guidance on childhood obesity about food. It actually says, do not wait for dietary interventions, drug your child right away. And they're going down to six. 
> 
> So the research which Bobby's talking about, if we can get control of the research, that's what the bad people have realized. 
> 
> There's nothing higher in society than a Harvard or NIH study. All culture, all policy flows from that gold star scientific research and because the research has been co-opted that has trillions of dollars of ramifications. 
> 
> So if we in the next four years can get not with any ideology, but just get the conflicts out of the research that then impacts what doctors can do. 
> 
> They're stuck in this system from the top.
> 
> ...
> 
> Bobby Kennedy [00:54:45]
> 
> If I could wave a magic wand, I would put the same effort into this as we put into COVID: to declare a national emergency and to do things that are going to be really dramatic and bold that change very, very quickly.
> 
> President Trump wants to see, has told me, he wants to see concrete, measurable diminishment in chronic disease within two years. 
> 
> And, in order to do that, we need to operate very, very quickly. And we need to treat this with the same kind of urgency that we did, the COVID epidemic. 
> 
> This is a thousand times worse than COVID in terms of what it is the cause that it's imposing on our society and on our lives.
> 
> COVID was killing people mainly in the last year of their lives. 81, 82 was the average death from COVID.
> 
> But this is hurting people from the day that they're born and it's destroying lifespans of years. And the cost that it's imposing on us is existential. 
> 
> So we need to be able to respond very quickly and in order to do that we need to have a really good crack staff right now. 
> 
> We have the people, we need to get them paid, we need to get them housing in Florida, so they can be right there while we walk into these transition meetings, day after day.
> 
> ...
> 
> Calley Means [00:58:45]
> 
> We are pushing so hard. We've got the mandate. Now we just need to operationalize what Bobby's saying. 
> 
> So this is so helpful, but we're really trying to build out an incredible coalition, to both identify names to staff these 600 key positions and really just build, continue this movement. 
> 
> I mean, on the "All In" podcast, they said, well, Bobby and Trump, it's a realignment of American politics. 
> 
> So if we can build this coalition, get the right names, get the organization, we're going to get real change done. And I think really, really revolutionize American politics with this new coalition.
> 
> ...
> 
> Bobby Kennedy [01:00:01]
> 
> I see what's happening now that we have to restore people's mental health. We have to restore their physical health and create, right now start growing a new generation of kids that is super healthy, the way that Americans were when I was a kid.
> 
> But there's also spiritual health in this country. And that I think is at the core of everything that we're engaged now in spiritual warfare. And it's spiritual warfare against this kind of elite technocracy that's trying to take away our power and take away our rights and to commoditize our health, our children, our landscapes, everything that we value in this country. 
> 
> And, there's no other country in the world that has what we have in this country. I'm always skeptical of people who talk about America as an exemplary nation, because it's been used to justify warfare and, military dominance of the globe. 
> 
> But the truth is today, we are the last redoubt for personal freedom in the world. There's no country in Europe that has a constitution like we do. 
> 
> We have the constitution in the United States is unique on earth. And, we had this, we were part of this project to take all those freedoms away from us. 
> 
> And, you know, thank God in some ways for COVID because it was progressing, without any kind of interference for many years. 
> 
> And-- and people weren't noticing it. And I think so many people now have woken up and seen that this is the most existential threat to us. 
> 
> And, and it's a spiritual threat. It's going to-- but the United States now has an opportunity because of this election to reverse that trend here, and then to rescue the rest of the world. 
> 
> And, so I'm very, very optimistic about the future under this president. I'm watching what's happening and there is nothing that I'm seeing, on day to day at moral, that-- my level of hope and optimism increases every day. 
> 
> So, you know, I'm, I'm very happy and I think let's go forward. Let's be kind to the people. 
> 
> We need to fight for them, all those people, your relatives who hate you, and won't talk to you anymore. We need to be fighting for them until they can wake up and fight for themselves.

## FDA's Robert Califf at Friends of Cancer Research event

> Robert Califf, FDA [00:10:47]
> 
> Personally I'm disappointed in the election, and it's not about me because, I think it's pretty well known, I had not planned on coming back to FDA until I got a call asking me to come back. I was having a pretty good life in Alphabet land. And, so I came back and I feel like from the FDA perspective, we are sort of got all engines on go right now, we've done a massive reorganization. We've got very significant plans. There's a meeting going on today that I just left going over the hiring, we're hiring pretty well and not having trouble getting very talented people. 
> 
> And I think, we just don't know what's going to happen now. So it's not correct of me to make any specific comments about exactly what will happen, but I do think it's pretty clear that the gist of this administration from everything that's been said is to change a lot of things and how it gets changed depends on who gets appointed into key positions and how the various policies play out. 
> 
> And I also think how the broader, as FDA is concerned, how the broader regulated industries see things and play into this. 
> 
> So, in times of changing chaos, there's also opportunity. And, I will just comment, there are a lot of things that I'll bet almost everyone in leadership positions in the health agencies would've liked to have changed, but couldn't because of the sort of gridlock of various interests that made it difficult to change things. 
> 
> So, I think this obviously I'm biased, but I feel like the FDA is sort of at peak performance right now. And, we'll just see what happens as a new team comes in.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:13:10]
> 
> I'm curious how you respond to the kinds of threats that have been made by people like RFK Jr. saying very specifically that he wants to clear out FDA groups that work in certain categories like nutrition and who knows what else? 
> 
> Because from the outside, we see that and we're like, oh my God, I can't believe he just said that. But you at the agency, how do you guys take that kind of threat? How do you respond to something like that? Well, that's out there, it's going viral. It's being-- it's all over the place.
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:13:36]
> 
> In my role, it's best not to respond to those kinds of things, because what-- getting into a back and forth about hypotheticals is not productive for anyone. 
> 
> I will say, I was, I'm not an expert on food. And my first term, Steve Ostroff had been the acting commissioner and he did have food expertise and he became the deputy commissioner when I came in and handled most of that. 
> 
> So this time around though, it's been, the majority of my time, for example, has been on food. And, I don't think you have to be too smart to say, we have a chronic disease crisis going on in this country that starts in childhood with terrible diets that are not getting better. And, there is work that needs to be done.
> 
> But I still love Alastair Woods's old article in the New England Journal, kick the FDA, America's favorite sport.
> 
> The things that go on with the American diet, they're the people who work in the nutrition of FDA-- I've gotten to know them pretty well. They are really hard working people and they're limited in what they can change by the laws that Congress passes. 
> 
> And, so, I don't want to get into a back and forth about it. I would just say, I want to stand by the people who work at FDA. 
> 
> They're good people, there's hardworking, and they want what's best for the American public. I have no question about that.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [00:15:17]
> 
> Do you foresee any kind of mass exodus or change at the agency at the sort of the staff, the drug reviewer level, based on the what's happened in the election?
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:15:27]
> 
> I think people are waiting to see, and from things that have been said, the change could happen internally or for external decisions made by the administration. 
> 
> So I just think we have to wait and see and have some faith that hardworking high quality people are going to still be in place and will have support, I hope from the external regulated community, which given the dynamics is likely to be the most important factor. 
> 
> I don't think that there's a lot that people inside of FDA can say. 
> 
> And you know, what I've seen already is that they're putting their heads down and doing their work.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:19:07]
> 
> First of all, it is very clear, that there is a hierarchy of-- it's an executive branch. 
> 
> So you got a commissioner, and you've got an HHS secretary and you got a president. And the tradition in 99.95% of FDA decisions about individual products, is that those decisions are made by career civil servants. 
> 
> The commissioner actually has no role in that, unless there's an internal dissent and an appeal, or in some cases, an external appeal that makes it all the way up to the commissioner level, but it's totally within the law for the president or the HHS secretary to overrule the entire FDA. 
> 
> And, so that could happen. Did it happen to me? No. But I also want to say, I think the view that there's a sharp line between political and scientific, we got to speak truthfully about this. It's not a sharp line in many cases.
> 
> I feel like for individual product decisions where you have high quality evidence, where the criteria is based on survive, feel, or function, the sort of standard criteria for medical products, there is no role for politics there. If a drug enables people to live longer and the benefit risk equation is positive by law, the FDA should approve it.
> 
> But there's so many other aspects of this that are integrated in various ways with politics. And there's just no way around it. 
> 
> I have a whole series of essays I'm going to write when I finish. I'm up to over 90, but three of them are on something called OIRA, which I've been asking as I go around to public health schools and other places I've been doing lately because of H5N1, no one knows what OIRA is. 
> 
> But as I think, you know, if FDA wants to put out a rule, which is interpreting a law, basically that Congress has passed in a way that has a huge impact on what happens, it cannot get through without OIRA letting it through. And that's a political arm of the White House. 
> 
> So, to argue that there's no integration of politics and science, I think is a mistake, and we're going to need to talk bluntly about this, I predict, as we go through the next phase.

> 
> Well, I think in the ideal-- you know, I'm an observer of this, I've never been a center director. I've never been a staff. I was a deputy commissioner for a while, so I'm just an observer.
> 
> But this is part of what I mentioned with executive function. In the ideal world, as I said, that uncertainty is being reduced. I think the most underappreciated part of the FDA is all those meetings that occur before the final application goes in. 
> 
> And during the course of those meetings, if there's a controversy in the ideal circumstance, the staff and the leadership of the center would be in conversations to resolve those issues. So overruling would be unnecessary. 
> 
> So in the ideal world, you should never have to overrule your staff, but we don't live in an ideal world and we have personalities in the FDA and we also have a situation in a way it was sort of the good old days when I was on the cardiorenal panel, there was one FDA opinion. 
> 
> Now it was opaque what all the different sub opinions were within that. Now, everyone can express their opinion in writing. And so that leads to a much more give and take between the center director and the staff. 
> 
> So-- but I think a goal of any center director would be to make it so that was, the goal should be sort of like ventilator acquired pneumonia, zero should be the goal, realizing in the real world, you can't quite achieve that.
> 
> ...

> Question [00:33:47]
> 
> Do you have two or three priorities that you you have set on or what are sort of the few things that you wanna get accomplished in the time you have left at the agency?
> 
> Robert Califf, FDA [00:33:56]
> 
> Well, I feel like the medical products are on the way and there's some very significant, relatively technical things that need to get done. 
> 
> The big deal for the public health is tobacco and food. And we have major things there that we're hoping to get done. 
> 
> It's publicly known, the menthol rule has been an issue, and we also have a very good understanding of what the addictive level of nicotine is. So the nicotine standard would be the biggest deal. 
> 
> We can't enforce a nicotine standard, but we could possibly put out a proposed rule that would unveil to the public what's at stake in terms of public health. 
> 
> And then for food, it's just simple stuff. Like, how can it be that you can't get the label on the front of the package? That just sounds crazy to me, but it's a ordeal. 
> 
> Many in the industry are opposed to it, and we're trying to update the term healthy so that when you put, let's face it, most people are busy when they go shopping. They don't study the label and take 10 minutes for every decision. They react to what's in front of them. 
> 
> So if we could just label things that are basically healthy as healthy, that would make a big difference. Those are the very, most important things. 
> 
> I don't wanna belittle the medical product side, but the changes there are technical and very important to the elements that are involved, but food and tobacco that's what's causing the chronic and serious crisis we're having right now in our life expectancy.
