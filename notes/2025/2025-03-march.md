> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:00:43]
> 
> Some years we have hundreds of measles outbreaks. We have measles outbreaks every year. And you know, part of that is that there are people who don't vaccinate, but also the vaccine itself wanes. The vaccine wanes about 4.5% per year. So that means older people are essentially unvaccinated. 
> 
> They aren't-- their immune system is not protected. And one of the problems is that tends to shift measles infections to older groups and also to very young children. So, if you get -- it used to be when I were kids, everybody got measles and measles gave you protective, lifetime protection against measles infection. The vaccine doesn't do that. 
> 
> The vaccine is effective for some people for life, but many people it wanes. And one of the problems is it does not appear to provide maternal immunity. It used to be a very young kid, you don't want a very-- a one year old kid getting measles. That's very dangerous. They were protected by breast milk and by maternal immunity.
> 
> And women who get vaccinated do not provide that level of maternal immunity that the natural measles infection did. So you're now seeing measles hit very, very young kids and hitting older people within whom the vaccine has waned. And that is something that we need to worry about. And that we're looking at HHS.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:02:37]
> 
> Death is very, you know, from measles historically, it was between one and 1 in 1,200 and 1 in 10,000. And so it does not have a high infection fatality rate. And the people who tended to die were people who had comorbidities and they were malnourished, which is less a problem because we, the vaccine came around in 1963 and the WICS program, which fed all of these hungry kids in our country came in in 64. 
> 
> And so-- but it's something that we're worried about. It's something that we're keeping an eye on. I've met, I've spoken with Governor Abbott, I've spoken with health officials all over Texas. I've spoken with the family of the one girl who died and it's a heartbreaking story. And-- and I've spoken with health officials all over.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr.[00:03:54] 
> 
> I'm a freedom of choice person. We should have transparency. We should have an informed choice. And-- but if people don't want it, they shouldn't be-- the government shouldn't force them to do it.
> 
> There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year, it causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes. Encephalitis, and blindness, etc. And so people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves. 
> 
> And what we need to do is give them the best information, encourage them to vaccinate, the vaccine does stop the spread of the disease.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:05:23]
> 
> First of all, avian flu will never be eradicated. It is endemic in wild populations of birds and particularly mallards. And that's what infects the domestic flocks.
> 
> And so you'll never get rid of it and it doesn't appear to hurt wild birds. They have some kind of immunity. 
> 
> And the strategy-- the White House, all of my agencies have advised against vaccination of birds. Because if you vaccinate with a leaky vaccine, in other words, a vaccine that does not provide sterilizing immunity, that does not absolutely protect against the disease, you turn those flocks into mutation factories.
> 
> They're generating, they're teaching the organism how to mutate and it's much-- it destabilizes it. And it's much more likely to jump to animals if you do that. 
> 
> So all my agency heads from NIH, CDC and FDA had all said, we should not be vaccinating, it's dangerous for human beings to vaccinate the birds. 
> 
> The question is, should you cull those blocks? Most of our scientists are against the culling operation. They think that we should be testing therapeutics on those flocks. They should isolate them. You should let the disease go through them and identify the birds that survive, which are the birds that probably have a genetic capacity, genetic inclination for immunity. And those should be the birds that we breed, like the wild population. 
> 
> Right now, the White House strategy is to repopulate those farms that have been depopulated. We've killed 166 million chickens. That's why we have an egg crisis. 
> 
> And, the disease is not passed through food. So you cannot get it, as far as we know, you cannot get it from an egg or or milk or meat from an infected animal.
> 
> The White House strategy now, and Brooke Rollins who runs USDA and I am all on board with this. Now we should armor the domestic populations to insulate them from wild infiltration.
> 
> This is how these birds are getting infected, a wild mallard, most of them are in open air poultry farms. A mallard will fly in to eat some of the corn and that infected mallard will infect the flock. 
> 
> And so I think that that is the best strategy and also to intensively test therapeutic drugs on those flocks, so that, for example, you tell you-- you put a therapy in with half the population. And if that half that is treated survives, now you have a drug that potentially is useful in human beings to treat avian flu.
> 
> That's what we should be doing.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:08:25]
> 
> I saw him yesterday and I think he's lost 30 pounds.
> 
> Sean Hannity [00:08:28]
> 
> Okay. He looks great. And he told me he's not using, for example, if he has a burger now, he usually doesn't have it with a bun.
> 
> He's made--
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:08:38]
> 
> I didn't know that he was actually changing his diet.
> 
> Sean Hannity [00:08:40]

> Oh, you didn't know that part?

> Processed foods and seed oil is one of the components of processed foods. And that is, you know, all the science indicates that ultra processed foods are what are behind the principal culprit in this extraordinary explosion, the epidemic we have, of chronic disease.
> 
> When my uncle was president, 3% of Americans had chronic disease. Today, 60% do. We have 66% of adults are diabetic or prediabetic, 38% of teens. 
> 
> When you and I were kids, Sean, the average pediatrician would see one case of juvenile diabetes in his lifetime, over a 40 or 50 year career. Today, one out of every three kids who walks through his office door is diabetic or pre diabetic.

> Popeyes, Outback, Sweet Green, Buffalo Wild, they've all made the switch or they're in the transition of making the switch.

> There are studies coming out of Stanford and Harvard that show a lot of mental illness, including anxiety and depression, are related to food. And that changing your diet, food is medicine, by changing your diet, you can lose some of those diagnoses.

> Well, what would you base the decision on?

> MAKARY
> 
> Well, you can ask the Biden administration that chose not to convene the committee meeting for the COVID booster.
> 
> ...
> 
> 11:06:13 MAKARY
> 
> I do think it makes sense to review the totality of data and ongoing data. 
> 
> I know personally of OB doctors who prefer to insist, even though they have the option to prescribe otherwise, but they choose to insist that mifepristone be taken when necessary, in their office, as they observe the person taking it. 
> 
> And I think their concern there is that if this drug is in the wrong hands, it could be used for coercion.
> 
> ...
> 
> 
> 11:17:56 MAKARY
> 
> So I think seed oils are a good example of where we could benefit from a consolidation of the scientific research. And I don't think it's any one ingredient in the food supply that's making our nation's children sick.
> 
> With a 30% rate of insulin resistance and diabetes in American teenagers today, that is a massive signal in the data. And so I think we have to look at the totality of every single thing in school lunch programs, in the diet of our nation's children, when we're using tax dollars to make purchases of foods that we know make our nation's children sick, we have to reexamine how we're spending those tax dollars. 
> 
> So one thing I would like to work on is a school lunch program for some school districts on a pilot basis to transition to healthier foods. A lot of school districts want to, but they don't know how, and they may not have the funds. So I've been discussing this with Jay Bhattacharya and others in the administration. 
> 
> And I hope that's something we can do.

## Robert F Kennedy Jr on Fox Nation interview about measles and others

- **Source:** video
- **Attribution:** Fox Nation
- **Date:** published March 4, 2025

> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:04:04]
> 
> I've been in touch with the governor, with Governor Abbott, who I talked to last week, as you know.
> 
> A little girl died. She was a member of the Mennonite community. She was unvaccinated and she's the first measles death since 2015 in our country, the second measles death since 2005. 
> 
> So the disease is a self-limiting childhood disease of the four childhood diseases of mumps, chickenpox, German measles, also known as rubella. It was always the most serious, it can cause death. It can cause encephalopathy and pneumonia and blindness.
> 
> In rare cases, the death rate for measles in our country, in 1963, prior to the introduction of the vaccines was about 1 in 1,200 to 1 in 10,000. So it's a very, very low infection fatality rate. The overall population death rate of measles was about one in half a million. 
> 
> But it can result in very serious consequences in some cases, and we are doing everything we can that that to make sure that that doesn't happen again, that people have access to good medicines, including those who want them, to vaccines, which do prevent infection. 
> 
> I've been in touch with the department of health there, with leaders of the Mennonite community. I have spoken to the parents of the child who died. It was very, very emotional and long conversation with them. 
> 
> And I think I have some understanding of what's happening in the Mennonite community and why they have this resistance. 
> 
> But I've also spoken to frontline doctors, which is something that I think the CDC has not been good at doing in the past, to see what's working. 
> 
> There are two wonderful doctors there. A doctor called Richard Bartlett and another called Ed Benjamin.
> 
> Ed Benjamin is a family physician from Lubbock. Richard Barlett is an emergency room physician from Midland and Amarillo. 
> 
> And they have treated most of the patients, actually, over 108 patients in the last 48 hours. And they're getting very, very good results they report from budesonide, which is a steroid, it's a 30 year old steroid and they clarithromycin and also cod liver oil, which has high concentrations of vitamin A and vitamin D. And they're seeing what they describe as almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery from that. 
> 
> We don't make it at HHS because we haven't done a clinical trial on those and we should have, but we haven't, and we're going to.
> 
> We need to look at those therapies and other therapies. We need to really do a good job of talking to the frontline doctors and see what is working on the ground, because those therapeutics have really been ignored by the agency for a long, long time.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:07:54]
> 
> What Dr. Bartlett and Dr. Benjamin have said, what other doctors say, is that the best, the safest application of vitamin A is through cod liver oil, because, you're getting it through food and you're not-- and the toxicity issue is no longer an issue. 
> 
> You can test people at the hospital for vitamin A, there are lots of good studies out there, and there's not the kind of studies that we should be doing that we're doing now, but there's lots of good studies out there that show that even as a prophylaxis, it's effective in early treatment, mild cases.
> 
> You could ideally test people for vitamin A deficiencies, when they first get sick, but this rarely happens and it's more expensive. And we recommend to local physicians that they consider vitamin A in their protocols, but also, you know, we're going to try to provide as best we can, the experiences of frontline doctors, so that physicians really have a battery and arsenal of therapies to use when children actually do get sick.
> 
> You pointed out there is malnutrition in west Texas, in Gaines county, and in the Mennonite community. The doctors that I'm talking to on the ground, the leaders, the community are reporting that the people who are getting sick are people who are, and the little girl who died, were malnutrition may have been an issue in her death. 
> 
> So there's a lot of poverty in that area, the food is kind of a food desert. The best thing that Americans can do is to keep themselves healthy.
> 
> It is very, very difficult for measles to kill a healthy person. So if you're healthy, well nourished, in fact, the-- measles at one point was killing about 10,000 people a year in our country at the time, but those deaths were eliminated through nutrition and sanitation.
> 
> Measles still is a very, very lethal disease in foreign countries and developed countries where there's malnutrition, that's mainly-- and there were in 1963 prior to the introduction of the vaccine, there was about 400 people who died from measles. Almost all of them were malnourished children. 
> 
> And so nutrition is absolutely critical and we need to eat good foods. We need to eat whole foods. We need to get plenty of exercise. And we see a correlation between people who get hurt by measles and people who are-- who don't have good nutrition or who don't have good exercise regimen.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:11:35]
> 
> Measles vaccines protects the community. And there are people who cannot be, who should not be vaccinated in the community because they have autoimmune disease or other immune problems. 
> 
> And if you do get vaccinated, you're protecting those people from a possible spread.
> 
> The vaccine is contraindicated for people who are already sick, but it appears to work for people who are exposed or are likely to be exposed. So in highly unvaccinated communities like Mennonites, it's something that we recommend. 
> 
> But we also understand, there's a lot of mistrust of the vaccines in that community. One of the consistent themes was that the Mennonites have told me and their leaders is there's a number of vaccine injured kids, about a dozen, in that community. 
> 
> And when we said, when I said, I'm going to send CDC and we have a CDC team arriving today, and I said that to the Mennonites, they said, well, we want them to also look into our vaccine injured kids and look them in the eye. 
> 
> So they have religious reasons. They have other reasons with CDC in the past, has not done a good job at quantifying the risk of vaccines. We are going to do that now, so that people can make a real informed choice about what's best for them, for their families and their communities. 
> 
> At this point, we are recommending that people in those communities get vaccines. We understand a lot of them will not. And we're going to try to make sure that they're taken care of through the best therapeutic interventions that we can provide them or recommend for them.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:14:02]
> 
> We're making sure that anybody who wants a vaccine can get that vaccine. And-- but we also recognize there is religious reasons, and there is other barriers of mistrust for our government. 
> 
> And we're trying to remedy that. My approach to this issue is just going to be absolute radical transparency. 
> 
> We're going to get the information. You know, we have a vaccine surveillance system in this country that just doesn't work. The CDC system, the CDC was ordered in 1986-- when we gave-- when Congress gave immunity from liability to vaccine companies, it ordered CDC to create a surveillance system that really captures all vaccine injuries.
> 
> Under CDC's own studies, show that the current system that we have, the VAERS system, the vaccine adverse event reporting system, captures fewer than 1% of vaccine injury. That is absolutely inexcusable. 
> 
> People need to know. We don't know what the risk profile is for these products. Americans have the right to know, to be able to make an informed choice. You need to know the cost and the benefits, and we've never quantified the cost. 
> 
> And that's why there's so much mistrust and we need to restore government trust. And we're gonna do that by telling the truth. And by doing rigorous science, understand both safety and efficacy issues.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:17:19]
> 
> And we've in fact, said at the USDA, that they should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds and preserve the birds that are immune to it. 
> 
> The vaccines do not-- there's no indication that those vaccines actually provide sterilizing immunity and all three of my health agencies, NIH, CDC, and FDA, the acting heads of those agencies have all recommended against the use of the bird flu vaccine for that particular genotype, because the vaccine could actually promote antigenic shift, which means you're turning those birds into mutant factories. 
> 
> And that could actually accelerate the jump to human beings. There's never in history that we know of, bird flu's been around for a hundred years. There's never been human to human transmission. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:19:55]
> 
> We're really taking direction from the state health departments and from Governor Abbott.
> 
> Right now, we have-- we're delivering vitamin A, we are providing assistance if people need ambulance rides. 
> 
> You know, there's a very-- Gaines County where most the cases occurred is a very remote county. The nearest urgent care is in Seminole, Texas. And then, but the nearest real hospital is in Lubbock, which could be 70 or 80 miles from these cases.
> 
> Some of the Mennonites have said to me that they don't feel comfortable going to Lubbock. They feel that there is religious prejudice that there's--  that has been a theme in their expression. 
> 
> So what we're trying to do is really to restore faith in government and to make sure that we are there to help them with their needs and not particularly to dictate what they ought to be doing.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:22:39]
> 
> We have this chronic disease epidemic. 
> 
> And, you know, as I said, we've had two measles death in 20 years in this country, we have a hundred thousand autism diagnosises every year. 
> 
> So, we need to keep our eye on the ball. Chronic disease is our enemy.
> 
> We had during COVID the highest death rate on the planet. We had 16% of the COVID deaths in our country, and we only have 4.2% of the global population. Why is that? 
> 
> CDC says that it's because we have the highest chronic disease burden in the world. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:23:32]
> 
> We need to understand the relationship between good health and chronic disease. 
> 
> If you are healthy, it's almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease, in modern times, because we have nutrition, because we have access to medicines. 
> 
> It's very, very difficult for an infectious disease to kill a healthy human being. So we need to get America healthy again, and that will take care of 99 percent.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:25:03]
> 
> I went to measles parties when I was a kid, I went to chicken pox parties, and I had natural immunity and there's a lot of studies out there that show that if you actually do get the wild infection, you're protected later, it boosts your immune system later in life against cancers, atopic disease, cardiac disease, etc.
> 
> It's not well studied. It ought to be well studied because we ought to understand those relationships. But I would never advise somebody to get sick, but I-- what we need is good science on all of these things so that people can make rational choices.
> 
> And it is well known and it was well known during COVID and very well documented and natural immunity in every viral infection that we know that natural immunity is broader spectrum and more durable. In other words, it's much more robust and lasts much longer than vaccine-induced immunity, including with measles. 
> 
> So, we need to understand all of those things, and we need to get people so that they're making rational choices that protect themselves, that protect their communities and protect particularly people who have immune problems in their communities. 
> 
> So vaccination is part of that arsenal, but we're not going to focus in on the only thing. We're going to look at these more holistically.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:26:48]
> 
> This is one of those things that we worry about in the culling operations is that the states are using all different kinds of PCR cycles. 
> 
> And some of those may be finding viruses where the virus is dead and harmless and then killing all the birds. And that doesn't make sense.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:28:32]
> 
> I read that story. I don't know anything about it. We-- I never spoke to that person. 
> 
> All of the agencies are consulted and all of them, what we're doing is consensual, right? Everything that we've done is consensual in all the agencies.
> 
> I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated. And, so they may have made up a story to explain their termination and then, you know, quit before before he got that news. 
> 
> So, but I don't know anything about him, as I said, I've never met him.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:29:30]
> 
> The explanation that I read in Politico was not true. There was no dispute between me and this individual. 
> 
> And as far as I know, we haven't heard anything from our agencies, from my subagencies, from CDC and NIH and FDA, except, all of the steps that we're taking are consensual. All of them are the product of long debates and conversations.

> SIEGEL: To provide many more doses of the shot in Texas, though he continues to believe at the same time in personal choice, he says, most of the people impacted are part of the Mennonite community, including an unvaccinated little girl who tragically died.
> 
> KENNEDY:
> 
> In highly unvaccinated communities like the Mennonites, it's something that we recommend. 
> 
> But we also understand, you know, there's a lot of mistrust of the vaccines in that community (TRANSITION) and there are people who cannot be, who should not be vaccinated in the community because they have autoimmune disease or other immune problems.
> 
> And if you do get vaccinated, you're protecting those people from a possible spread.
> 
> SIEGEL: 
> 
> He says, a startling 108 patients were treated in Texas in the last 48 hours, and that therapies, such as the use of cod liver oil which contains vitamin A and D are working.
> 
> He says, the sudden resignation of HHS employee Thomas Corry was not over a clash about the outbreak as reported by Politico.
> 
> KENNEDY:
> 
> I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated, and so they may have made up a story to explain their termination, and then, you know, quit before he got that news.
> 
> So-- but I don't know anything about him. As I said, I've never met him.
> 
> SIEGEL:
> 
> Secretary Kennedy, inspired by his father's commitment to public health for all Americans, as he related to me, plans to focus on improving the Indian Health Service.
> 
> KENNEDY:
> 
> Indian Health Service has been the red-headed stepchild of the of HHS. It's chronically underfunded. It usually receives about 30% of what it really needs.
> 
> SIEGEL:
> 
> Kennedy is also calling for transparency, more studies on vaccines and accurate reporting of vaccine injury.
