> “The measles outbreak is a top priority for Secretary Kennedy as he noted in this op-ed Sunday,” said Senior Counselor and Principal Deputy Chief of Staff Stefanie Spear. “The CDC is actively supporting Texas state health officials and will be on the ground Tuesday working with the frontline health care providers.  
> 
> “As Kennedy said in his op-ed, ‘The measles outbreak in Texas is a call to action for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to public health. By working together -- parents, healthcare providers, community leaders, and government officials, we can prevent future outbreaks and protect the health of our nation. Under my leadership, HHS is and will always be committed to radical transparency to regain the public’s trust in its health agencies.’”
