> 10:17:42 SEN MURRAY
> 
> I want to know what you are reevaluating it on. What are you looking at to make a decision, whether to reconvene it?
> 
> MAKARY
> 
> In conjunction with the center director of the biologics center, I would reevaluate which topics deserve a convening of the advisory committee members on VRBPAC, and which may not require the convening.
> 
> Obviously, during--
> 
> SEN MURRAY
> 
> Well, what would you base the decision on?
> 
> MAKARY
> 
> Well, you can ask the Biden administration that chose not to convene the committee meeting for the COVID booster.
> 
> ...
> 
> 11:06:13 MAKARY
> 
> I do think it makes sense to review the totality of data and ongoing data. 
> 
> I know personally of OB doctors who prefer to insist, even though they have the option to prescribe otherwise, but they choose to insist that mifepristone be taken when necessary, in their office, as they observe the person taking it. 
> 
> And I think their concern there is that if this drug is in the wrong hands, it could be used for coercion.
> 
> ...
> 
> 
> 11:17:56 MAKARY
> 
> So I think seed oils are a good example of where we could benefit from a consolidation of the scientific research. And I don't think it's any one ingredient in the food supply that's making our nation's children sick.
> 
> With a 30% rate of insulin resistance and diabetes in American teenagers today, that is a massive signal in the data. And so I think we have to look at the totality of every single thing in school lunch programs, in the diet of our nation's children, when we're using tax dollars to make purchases of foods that we know make our nation's children sick, we have to reexamine how we're spending those tax dollars. 
> 
> So one thing I would like to work on is a school lunch program for some school districts on a pilot basis to transition to healthier foods. A lot of school districts want to, but they don't know how, and they may not have the funds. So I've been discussing this with Jay Bhattacharya and others in the administration. 
> 
> And I hope that's something we can do.

## Robert F Kennedy Jr on Fox Nation interview about measles and others

- **Date:** published March 4, 2025

> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:04:04]
> 
> I've been in touch with the governor, with Governor Abbott, who I talked to last week, as you know.
> 
> A little girl died. She was a member of the Mennonite community. She was unvaccinated and she's the first measles death since 2015 in our country, the second measles death since 2005. 
> 
> So the disease is a self-limiting childhood disease of the four childhood diseases of mumps, chickenpox, German measles, also known as rubella. It was always the most serious, it can cause death. It can cause encephalopathy and pneumonia and blindness.
> 
> In rare cases, the death rate for measles in our country, in 1963, prior to the introduction of the vaccines was about 1 in 1,200 to 1 in 10,000. So it's a very, very low infection fatality rate. The overall population death rate of measles was about one in half a million. 
> 
> But it can result in very serious consequences in some cases, and we are doing everything we can that that to make sure that that doesn't happen again, that people have access to good medicines, including those who want them, to vaccines, which do prevent infection. 
> 
> I've been in touch with the department of health there, with leaders of the Mennonite community. I have spoken to the parents of the child who died. It was very, very emotional and long conversation with them. 
> 
> And I think I have some understanding of what's happening in the Mennonite community and why they have this resistance. 
> 
> But I've also spoken to frontline doctors, which is something that I think the CDC has not been good at doing in the past, to see what's working. 
> 
> There are two wonderful doctors there. A doctor called Richard Bartlett and another called Ed Benjamin.
> 
> Ed Benjamin is a family physician from Lubbock. Richard Barlett is an emergency room physician from Midland and Amarillo. 
> 
> And they have treated most of the patients, actually, over 108 patients in the last 48 hours. And they're getting very, very good results they report from budesonide, which is a steroid, it's a 30 year old steroid and they clarithromycin and also cod liver oil, which has high concentrations of vitamin A and vitamin D. And they're seeing what they describe as almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery from that. 
> 
> We don't make it at HHS because we haven't done a clinical trial on those and we should have, but we haven't, and we're going to.
> 
> We need to look at those therapies and other therapies. We need to really do a good job of talking to the frontline doctors and see what is working on the ground, because those therapeutics have really been ignored by the agency for a long, long time.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:07:54]
> 
> What Dr. Bartlett and Dr. Benjamin have said, what other doctors say, is that the best, the safest application of vitamin A is through cod liver oil, because, you're getting it through food and you're not-- and the toxicity issue is no longer an issue. 
> 
> You can test people at the hospital for vitamin A, there are lots of good studies out there, and there's not the kind of studies that we should be doing that we're doing now, but there's lots of good studies out there that show that even as a prophylaxis, it's effective in early treatment, mild cases.
> 
> You could ideally test people for vitamin A deficiencies, when they first get sick, but this rarely happens and it's more expensive. And we recommend to local physicians that they consider vitamin A in their protocols, but also, you know, we're going to try to provide as best we can, the experiences of frontline doctors, so that physicians really have a battery and arsenal of therapies to use when children actually do get sick.
> 
> You pointed out there is malnutrition in west Texas, in Gaines county, and in the Mennonite community. The doctors that I'm talking to on the ground, the leaders, the community are reporting that the people who are getting sick are people who are, and the little girl who died, were malnutrition may have been an issue in her death. 
> 
> So there's a lot of poverty in that area, the food is kind of a food desert. The best thing that Americans can do is to keep themselves healthy.
> 
> It is very, very difficult for measles to kill a healthy person. So if you're healthy, well nourished, in fact, the-- measles at one point was killing about 10,000 people a year in our country at the time, but those deaths were eliminated through nutrition and sanitation.
> 
> Measles still is a very, very lethal disease in foreign countries and developed countries where there's malnutrition, that's mainly-- and there were in 1963 prior to the introduction of the vaccine, there was about 400 people who died from measles. Almost all of them were malnourished children. 
> 
> And so nutrition is absolutely critical and we need to eat good foods. We need to eat whole foods. We need to get plenty of exercise. And we see a correlation between people who get hurt by measles and people who are-- who don't have good nutrition or who don't have good exercise regimen.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:11:35]
> 
> Measles vaccines protects the community. And there are people who cannot be, who should not be vaccinated in the community because they have autoimmune disease or other immune problems. 
> 
> And if you do get vaccinated, you're protecting those people from a possible spread.
> 
> The vaccine is contraindicated for people who are already sick, but it appears to work for people who are exposed or are likely to be exposed. So in highly unvaccinated communities like Mennonites, it's something that we recommend. 
> 
> But we also understand, there's a lot of mistrust of the vaccines in that community. One of the consistent themes was that the Mennonites have told me and their leaders is there's a number of vaccine injured kids, about a dozen, in that community. 
> 
> And when we said, when I said, I'm going to send CDC and we have a CDC team arriving today, and I said that to the Mennonites, they said, well, we want them to also look into our vaccine injured kids and look them in the eye. 
> 
> So they have religious reasons. They have other reasons with CDC in the past, has not done a good job at quantifying the risk of vaccines. We are going to do that now, so that people can make a real informed choice about what's best for them, for their families and their communities. 
> 
> At this point, we are recommending that people in those communities get vaccines. We understand a lot of them will not. And we're going to try to make sure that they're taken care of through the best therapeutic interventions that we can provide them or recommend for them.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:14:02]
> 
> We're making sure that anybody who wants a vaccine can get that vaccine. And-- but we also recognize there is religious reasons, and there is other barriers of mistrust for our government. 
> 
> And we're trying to remedy that. My approach to this issue is just going to be absolute radical transparency. 
> 
> We're going to get the information. You know, we have a vaccine surveillance system in this country that just doesn't work. The CDC system, the CDC was ordered in 1986-- when we gave-- when Congress gave immunity from liability to vaccine companies, it ordered CDC to create a surveillance system that really captures all vaccine injuries.
> 
> Under CDC's own studies, show that the current system that we have, the VAERS system, the vaccine adverse event reporting system, captures fewer than 1% of vaccine injury. That is absolutely inexcusable. 
> 
> People need to know. We don't know what the risk profile is for these products. Americans have the right to know, to be able to make an informed choice. You need to know the cost and the benefits, and we've never quantified the cost. 
> 
> And that's why there's so much mistrust and we need to restore government trust. And we're gonna do that by telling the truth. And by doing rigorous science, understand both safety and efficacy issues.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:17:19]
> 
> And we've in fact, said at the USDA, that they should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds and preserve the birds that are immune to it. 
> 
> The vaccines do not-- there's no indication that those vaccines actually provide sterilizing immunity and all three of my health agencies, NIH, CDC, and FDA, the acting heads of those agencies have all recommended against the use of the bird flu vaccine for that particular genotype, because the vaccine could actually promote antigenic shift, which means you're turning those birds into mutant factories. 
> 
> And that could actually accelerate the jump to human beings. There's never in history that we know of, bird flu's been around for a hundred years. There's never been human to human transmission. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:19:55]
> 
> We're really taking direction from the state health departments and from Governor Abbott.
> 
> Right now, we have-- we're delivering vitamin A, we are providing assistance if people need ambulance rides. 
> 
> You know, there's a very-- Gaines County where most the cases occurred is a very remote county. The nearest urgent care is in Seminole, Texas. And then, but the nearest real hospital is in Lubbock, which could be 70 or 80 miles from these cases.
> 
> Some of the Mennonites have said to me that they don't feel comfortable going to Lubbock. They feel that there is religious prejudice that there's--  that has been a theme in their expression. 
> 
> So what we're trying to do is really to restore faith in government and to make sure that we are there to help them with their needs and not particularly to dictate what they ought to be doing.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:22:39]
> 
> We have this chronic disease epidemic. 
> 
> And, you know, as I said, we've had two measles death in 20 years in this country, we have a hundred thousand autism diagnosises every year. 
> 
> So, we need to keep our eye on the ball. Chronic disease is our enemy.
> 
> We had during COVID the highest death rate on the planet. We had 16% of the COVID deaths in our country, and we only have 4.2% of the global population. Why is that? 
> 
> CDC says that it's because we have the highest chronic disease burden in the world. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:23:32]
> 
> We need to understand the relationship between good health and chronic disease. 
> 
> If you are healthy, it's almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease, in modern times, because we have nutrition, because we have access to medicines. 
> 
> It's very, very difficult for an infectious disease to kill a healthy human being. So we need to get America healthy again, and that will take care of 99 percent.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:25:03]
> 
> I went to measles parties when I was a kid, I went to chicken pox parties, and I had natural immunity and there's a lot of studies out there that show that if you actually do get the wild infection, you're protected later, it boosts your immune system later in life against cancers, atopic disease, cardiac disease, etc.
> 
> It's not well studied. It ought to be well studied because we ought to understand those relationships. But I would never advise somebody to get sick, but I-- what we need is good science on all of these things so that people can make rational choices.
> 
> And it is well known and it was well known during COVID and very well documented and natural immunity in every viral infection that we know that natural immunity is broader spectrum and more durable. In other words, it's much more robust and lasts much longer than vaccine-induced immunity, including with measles. 
> 
> So, we need to understand all of those things, and we need to get people so that they're making rational choices that protect themselves, that protect their communities and protect particularly people who have immune problems in their communities. 
> 
> So vaccination is part of that arsenal, but we're not going to focus in on the only thing. We're going to look at these more holistically.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:26:48]
> 
> This is one of those things that we worry about in the culling operations is that the states are using all different kinds of PCR cycles. 
> 
> And some of those may be finding viruses where the virus is dead and harmless and then killing all the birds. And that doesn't make sense.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:28:32]
> 
> I read that story. I don't know anything about it. We-- I never spoke to that person. 
> 
> All of the agencies are consulted and all of them, what we're doing is consensual, right? Everything that we've done is consensual in all the agencies.
> 
> I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated. And, so they may have made up a story to explain their termination and then, you know, quit before before he got that news. 
> 
> So, but I don't know anything about him, as I said, I've never met him.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [00:29:30]
> 
> The explanation that I read in Politico was not true. There was no dispute between me and this individual. 
> 
> And as far as I know, we haven't heard anything from our agencies, from my subagencies, from CDC and NIH and FDA, except, all of the steps that we're taking are consensual. All of them are the product of long debates and conversations. 
> 
> We come to a consensus and we do what's right for the American people.

> 10:17:14 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> The NIH has played a pivotal role in my career. I served for a decade as a standing member of NIH grant committees. I helped train many trainees prepare for scientific careers with NIH support. And I want NIH funding to study population aging, chronic disease, and obesity. 
> 
> I've made the study of scientific institutions, including the NIH itself, a focus of my own scientific work. The NIH is the crown jewel of American biomedical sciences with a long and illustrious history of supporting breakthroughs in biology and medicine. 
> 
> I have the utmost respect for the NIH scientists and staff over the decades who have contributed to this success. The NIH's mission to support scientific discovery to enhance health and lengthen life is vital to our country's future and indeed the world's. 
> 
> I love the NIH, but post-pandemic, American biomedical sciences are at a crossroads. A November 2024 Pew study reported that only 26% of the American public had a great deal of confidence in scientists to act in the public's best interest.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:18:31 BHATTACHARYA 
> 
> I have five concrete goals, if confirmed as director of the NIH.
> 
> First, NIH research should focus on research that solves the American chronic disease crisis. American health is going backwards, life expectancy flatlined between 2012 and 2019, plummeted during the pandemic and still has not bounced back to pre-pandemic levels. The chronic disease crisis is severe with hundreds of millions of Americans, children and adults suffering from obesity, heart disease, cancer and more. If confirmed, I will carry out President Trump and Secretary Kennedy's agenda of committing the NIH to address the dire chronic health needs of the country with gold standard science and innovation. 
> 
> Second, NIH-supported science should be replicable, reproducible, and generalizable. Unfortunately, much modern biomedical science fails this basic test. The NIH itself just last year faced a research integrity scandal involving research on Alzheimer's disease that throws into question hundreds of research papers. If the data generated by scientists is not reliable, products of such science cannot help anyone. It is no stretch to think that the slow progress on Alzheimer's disease is linked to this problem. The NIH can and must solve the crisis of scientific data reliability. Under my leadership, if confirmed, it will do so. 
> 
> Third, if confirmed, I will establish a culture of respect for free speech in science and scientific dissent at the NIH. Over the last few years, top NIH officials oversaw a culture of cover-up, obfuscation, and a lack of tolerance for ideas that differed from theirs. Dissent is the very essence of science. I'll foster a culture where NIH leadership will actively encourage different perspectives and create an environment where scientists including early career scientists and scientists that disagree with me, can express disagreement respectfully. 
> 
> Fourth, the NIH must recommit to its mission to fund the most innovative biomedical research agenda possible to improve American health. My plan is to ensure that the NIH invests in cutting edge research in every field to make big advances rather than just small incremental progress over years. 
> 
> Fifth, the NIH must embrace and vigorously regulate risky research that has the possibility of causing a pandemic, must regulate risky research that has the possibility of causing a pandemic. It should embrace transparency in all its operations. While the vast majority of biomedical research poses no risk of harm to research subjects or the public, the NIH must ensure that it never supports work that might cause harm. If confirmed, I will work with Congress and the administration to guarantee that happens. 
> 
> While I believe there are real problems to be addressed, I want to finish by reiterating my great respect for the work and mission of the NIH. If confirmed, I'll carry out President Trump's agenda of making the public science institutions of this country worthy of trust. And serve to make America healthy again. 
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:22:45 BHATTACHARYA 
> 
> Senator, it's a tragedy that a child would die from a vaccine preventable disease. I fully support children being vaccinated for diseases like measles that can be prevented with the vaccination efforts. 
> 
> As far as research on autism and vaccines, I don't generally believe that there is a link. And based on my reading of the literature. 
> 
> But what I have seen is that there's tremendous distrust in medicine and science coming out of the pandemic. And we do have, as you know, Senator, a sharp rise in autism rates in this country. And I don't know, and I don't think any scientist really knows the cause of it. 
> 
> So I would support an agenda of a broad agenda, a broad scientific agenda based on data to get an answer to that.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:26:53 BHATTACHARYA 
> 
> I think the most important childhood health problems have to do with childhood diabetes, childhood obesity. We should be studying that. That's where the vast, vast majority of the effort should go. 
> 
> Prevention of childhood infectious diseases also, I think, is important. I mean, all of those are.
> 
> That's the priorities I'll have if I'm NIH director.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:27:52 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> I don't have a full answer to that question, but I agree with your concern. And the fact that we do pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. 
> 
> If I'm NIH director, if I'm confirmed as NIH director, I think there's a very specific thing that we haven't done but we should do. The NIH should fund research on off patent off-label use of off-patent drugs, inexpensive drugs. 
> 
> I'll give you an example from the pandemic, senator. There was a tremendous achievement, I think. There was a study done in the United Kingdom a cheap steroid called dexamethasone very early in the pandemic
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:28:42 SEN SANDERS
> 
> The NIH has, as we all know, spent billions of dollars in developing important drugs. And yet, despite that taxpayer expenditure, we end up paying far more than other countries. Should a company that benefits from the taxpayer dollar research, basic research at the NIH be able to charge any price that they want. Or should we attach to those contracts a reasonable pricing clause that says, hey, if we help develop this drug and it's effective, you're going to have to charge a reasonable price for it? 
> 
> 10:29:18 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Senator, that's an issue where I think previous NIH directors have said it's very difficult for, as for an NIH director alone to take action. 
> 
> I think that's something that Congress and the administration would have to work together. 
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:35:44 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Senator, I think that the resources the NIH the taxpayers give to the United States are precious. And if confirmed, I absolutely commit to changing the grant committee makeup so that they focus on the most important questions that impact American health. 
> 
> I mean, there needs to be a mix of basic science work, and I'm not a basic scientist myself, but I can understand how some somewhat abstract basic science work have advances. But at the same time, the research should really be focused on making America healthy. 
> 
> That's the mission of the NIH.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:38:10 SEN MURRAY
> 
> Do you support the recent researcher firings and grant freezes that have been implemented by Trump and DOGE?
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 
> 
> Senator, I was not involved in those decisions. If confirmed as NIH director, I fully commit to making sure that all the scientists at the NIH and the scientists that the NIH supports have the resources they need to meet the mission of the NIH, which is to make America do research to make America healthy. 
> 
> SEN MURRAY 
> 
> So do you support further cuts at NIH funding? Or staff? 
> 
> BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Senator, I don't support I don't have any intention to cut anyone at the NIH if I've been confirmed as director. Know about the grant freezes and the pauses on all the advisory committee meetings, all the pauses that are now in effect on clinical trials that are happening there right now. 
> 
> So, Senator, I've read the press accounts of it. It's hard to know outside. I've not interacted with people in the agency. 
> 
> SEN MURRAY
> 
> If you're confirmed day one, what will you do about that? 
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 
> 
> Senator, I'm going to assess it as day one. I'm going to understand what the resources the whole NIH needs and make sure that the scientists that are working at the NIH have the resources to do the life-saving work that they do and that the scientists that are supported by the NIH also have that. 
> 
> The personnel decisions are hard to talk about unless I'm actually confirmed, and I have more data.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:41:10 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Please let me finish. What I mean is that I don't know where that goes. I think that that a lot of it likely goes to the things that are worthwhile. And I've heard lots of folks, including from Stanford, who say that. And I agree with them. Support for buildings, light bulbs to make sure that we can see in the lab. 
> 
> And a whole host of other important things. But there's a lot of distrust about where the money goes because the trust in the public health establishment has collapsed in the pandemic. I think transparency regarding Indirect cost is absolutely worthwhile. 
> 
> And it's just something that universities can fix by working together to make sure that where that money goes is made clear. I want to make sure that the money goes to the research.

> Senator, if confirmed, I absolutely commit to following the law, to addressing this issue very directly. 
> 
> I think that this is one of these issues to me, it's an indicator of distrust that that some have of universities and of the scientific process. And so I want to make sure that we address those concerns as well.

> I believe very fundamentally that there are very promising potential ways to prevent Alzheimer's that have not received support, including from some colleagues of mine at Stanford University, because they haven't aligned with a single dominant narrative about what causes Alzheimer's. 
> 
> I want to expand the set of things that we look at as a possible cause for Alzheimer's so that we can make advances. We should have had, I think, much more advances for the investments we've made to date. And I want to make sure that all the hypotheses that are out there get addressed because it's a vitally important problem, as you say, not just humanitarian. Not just for health, but also for the fiscal health of our country.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:55:37 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Yeah, I mean, there's a whole set of projects, senator, that have focused by the NIH on a particular hypothesis, the amyloid hypothesis at the expense of other hypotheses. 
> 
> I agree with you about humility. That's the key to scientific progress. We have to, as scientists say, we might be wrong. Because when we meet data that disagrees with us, where we have ideas that we disagree with, maybe that other idea is right and we're the one that's wrong. 
> 
> It's only by, if I'm confirmed as NIH director, I want to make sure that all the range of hypotheses are supported. That's how you make progress. 
> 
> One of the reasons I think that we have not made progress in Alzheimer's as much as we ought to have is because we've gotten, the NIH has not supported a sufficiently wide range of hypotheses.

> One of the things I was actually involved in the case that resulted in the Florida of kids being able to go back to school. So even as my kids were left out of school, basically not allowed to go back into the school buildings for a year and a half, the kids of Florida were allowed.

> And as a result, the results are so much better. Florida has a lower all-cause excess death rate during the pandemic than California did.

> So I think Florida's response to the pandemic was tremendous success. But I'm really glad you highlighted the role of censorship and restriction of scientific discussion.

> It was so refreshing to me to be allowed to speak my scientific views in Florida during the pandemic. I think the root problem, it's a pandemic is a very difficult thing. So many people are going to have different ideas in an environment of uncertainty.

> It's not that no mistakes were ever made. You can't say that of any state in a pandemic. But in order to do well, you have to allow people to speak with each other openly, even when the ideas are controversial.

> Senator, I think that the funds that have been spent to date on long COVID have not provided answers to the millions of patients. I think that they deserve answers.

Because during the pandemic, I would often be on Catholic radio, and people would ask me whether the mRNA vaccines were made or develop with fetal cell lines, I had to say yes. And they had a lot of the folks who were calling in had ethical objections. 
> 
> In public health, we need to make sure the products of the science are ethically acceptable to everybody. And so having alternatives that are not ethically conflicted fetal stem cell lines is not just an ethical issue, but it's a public health issue. We need to make sure that everyone is willing to take the kinds of progress that we make. And so I'm absolutely committed to that.

I want to sound the alarm that some very dangerous things are happening to scientists and researchers at NIH right now and I want to ask you whether you believe that it is appropriate, and you mentioned a moment ago about a concept around knowledge and freedom for scientists, and whether you believe it is appropriate under any circumstance to retaliate against scientists or medical researchers based on the research they have done. Do you believe that?

> 02:32:03 PM
> 
> SIEGEL: To provide many more doses of the shot in Texas, though he continues to believe at the same time in personal choice, he says, most of the people impacted are part of the Mennonite community, including an unvaccinated little girl who tragically died.
> 
> KENNEDY:
> 
> In highly unvaccinated communities like the Mennonites, it's something that we recommend. 
> 
> But we also understand, you know, there's a lot of mistrust of the vaccines in that community (TRANSITION) and there are people who cannot be, who should not be vaccinated in the community because they have autoimmune disease or other immune problems.
> 
> And if you do get vaccinated, you're protecting those people from a possible spread.
> 
> SIEGEL: 
> 
> He says, a startling 108 patients were treated in Texas in the last 48 hours, and that therapies, such as the use of cod liver oil which contains vitamin A and D are working.
> 
> He says, the sudden resignation of HHS employee Thomas Corry was not over a clash about the outbreak as reported by Politico.
> 
> KENNEDY:
> 
> I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated, and so they may have made up a story to explain their termination, and then, you know, quit before he got that news.
> 
> So-- but I don't know anything about him. As I said, I've never met him.
> 
> SIEGEL:
> 
> Secretary Kennedy, inspired by his father's commitment to public health for all Americans, as he related to me, plans to focus on improving the Indian Health Service.
> 
> KENNEDY:
> 
> Indian Health Service has been the red-headed stepchild of the of HHS. It's chronically underfunded. It usually receives about 30% of what it really needs.
> 
> SIEGEL:
> 
> Kennedy is also calling for transparency, more studies on vaccines and accurate reporting of vaccine injury.

- **Date:** received March 3, 2025

> “The measles outbreak is a top priority for Secretary Kennedy as he noted in this op-ed Sunday,” said Senior Counselor and Principal Deputy Chief of Staff Stefanie Spear. “The CDC is actively supporting Texas state health officials and will be on the ground Tuesday working with the frontline health care providers.  
> 
> “As Kennedy said in his op-ed, ‘The measles outbreak in Texas is a call to action for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to public health. By working together -- parents, healthcare providers, community leaders, and government officials, we can prevent future outbreaks and protect the health of our nation. Under my leadership, HHS is and will always be committed to radical transparency to regain the public’s trust in its health agencies.’”
