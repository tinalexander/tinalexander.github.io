> 10:17:14 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> The NIH has played a pivotal role in my career. I served for a decade as a standing member of NIH grant committees. I helped train many trainees prepare for scientific careers with NIH support. And I want NIH funding to study population aging, chronic disease, and obesity. 
> 
> I've made the study of scientific institutions, including the NIH itself, a focus of my own scientific work. The NIH is the crown jewel of American biomedical sciences with a long and illustrious history of supporting breakthroughs in biology and medicine. 
> 
> I have the utmost respect for the NIH scientists and staff over the decades who have contributed to this success. The NIH's mission to support scientific discovery to enhance health and lengthen life is vital to our country's future and indeed the world's. 
> 
> I love the NIH, but post-pandemic, American biomedical sciences are at a crossroads. A November 2024 Pew study reported that only 26% of the American public had a great deal of confidence in scientists to act in the public's best interest.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:18:31 BHATTACHARYA 
> 
> I have five concrete goals, if confirmed as director of the NIH.
> 
> First, NIH research should focus on research that solves the American chronic disease crisis. American health is going backwards, life expectancy flatlined between 2012 and 2019, plummeted during the pandemic and still has not bounced back to pre-pandemic levels. The chronic disease crisis is severe with hundreds of millions of Americans, children and adults suffering from obesity, heart disease, cancer and more. If confirmed, I will carry out President Trump and Secretary Kennedy's agenda of committing the NIH to address the dire chronic health needs of the country with gold standard science and innovation. 
> 
> Second, NIH-supported science should be replicable, reproducible, and generalizable. Unfortunately, much modern biomedical science fails this basic test. The NIH itself just last year faced a research integrity scandal involving research on Alzheimer's disease that throws into question hundreds of research papers. If the data generated by scientists is not reliable, products of such science cannot help anyone. It is no stretch to think that the slow progress on Alzheimer's disease is linked to this problem. The NIH can and must solve the crisis of scientific data reliability. Under my leadership, if confirmed, it will do so. 
> 
> Third, if confirmed, I will establish a culture of respect for free speech in science and scientific dissent at the NIH. Over the last few years, top NIH officials oversaw a culture of cover-up, obfuscation, and a lack of tolerance for ideas that differed from theirs. Dissent is the very essence of science. I'll foster a culture where NIH leadership will actively encourage different perspectives and create an environment where scientists including early career scientists and scientists that disagree with me, can express disagreement respectfully. 
> 
> Fourth, the NIH must recommit to its mission to fund the most innovative biomedical research agenda possible to improve American health. My plan is to ensure that the NIH invests in cutting edge research in every field to make big advances rather than just small incremental progress over years. 
> 
> Fifth, the NIH must embrace and vigorously regulate risky research that has the possibility of causing a pandemic, must regulate risky research that has the possibility of causing a pandemic. It should embrace transparency in all its operations. While the vast majority of biomedical research poses no risk of harm to research subjects or the public, the NIH must ensure that it never supports work that might cause harm. If confirmed, I will work with Congress and the administration to guarantee that happens. 
> 
> While I believe there are real problems to be addressed, I want to finish by reiterating my great respect for the work and mission of the NIH. If confirmed, I'll carry out President Trump's agenda of making the public science institutions of this country worthy of trust. And serve to make America healthy again. 
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:22:45 BHATTACHARYA 
> 
> Senator, it's a tragedy that a child would die from a vaccine preventable disease. I fully support children being vaccinated for diseases like measles that can be prevented with the vaccination efforts. 
> 
> As far as research on autism and vaccines, I don't generally believe that there is a link. And based on my reading of the literature. 
> 
> But what I have seen is that there's tremendous distrust in medicine and science coming out of the pandemic. And we do have, as you know, Senator, a sharp rise in autism rates in this country. And I don't know, and I don't think any scientist really knows the cause of it. 
> 
> So I would support an agenda of a broad agenda, a broad scientific agenda based on data to get an answer to that.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:26:53 BHATTACHARYA 
> 
> I think the most important childhood health problems have to do with childhood diabetes, childhood obesity. We should be studying that. That's where the vast, vast majority of the effort should go. 
> 
> Prevention of childhood infectious diseases also, I think, is important. I mean, all of those are.
> 
> That's the priorities I'll have if I'm NIH director.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:27:52 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> I don't have a full answer to that question, but I agree with your concern. And the fact that we do pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. 
> 
> If I'm NIH director, if I'm confirmed as NIH director, I think there's a very specific thing that we haven't done but we should do. The NIH should fund research on off patent off-label use of off-patent drugs, inexpensive drugs. 
> 
> I'll give you an example from the pandemic, senator. There was a tremendous achievement, I think. There was a study done in the United Kingdom a cheap steroid called dexamethasone very early in the pandemic
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:28:42 SEN SANDERS
> 
> The NIH has, as we all know, spent billions of dollars in developing important drugs. And yet, despite that taxpayer expenditure, we end up paying far more than other countries. Should a company that benefits from the taxpayer dollar research, basic research at the NIH be able to charge any price that they want. Or should we attach to those contracts a reasonable pricing clause that says, hey, if we help develop this drug and it's effective, you're going to have to charge a reasonable price for it? 
> 
> 10:29:18 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Senator, that's an issue where I think previous NIH directors have said it's very difficult for, as for an NIH director alone to take action. 
> 
> I think that's something that Congress and the administration would have to work together. 
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:35:44 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Senator, I think that the resources the NIH the taxpayers give to the United States are precious. And if confirmed, I absolutely commit to changing the grant committee makeup so that they focus on the most important questions that impact American health. 
> 
> I mean, there needs to be a mix of basic science work, and I'm not a basic scientist myself, but I can understand how some somewhat abstract basic science work have advances. But at the same time, the research should really be focused on making America healthy. 
> 
> That's the mission of the NIH.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:38:10 SEN MURRAY
> 
> Do you support the recent researcher firings and grant freezes that have been implemented by Trump and DOGE?
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 
> 
> Senator, I was not involved in those decisions. If confirmed as NIH director, I fully commit to making sure that all the scientists at the NIH and the scientists that the NIH supports have the resources they need to meet the mission of the NIH, which is to make America do research to make America healthy. 
> 
> SEN MURRAY 
> 
> So do you support further cuts at NIH funding? Or staff? 
> 
> BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Senator, I don't support I don't have any intention to cut anyone at the NIH if I've been confirmed as director. Know about the grant freezes and the pauses on all the advisory committee meetings, all the pauses that are now in effect on clinical trials that are happening there right now. 
> 
> So, Senator, I've read the press accounts of it. It's hard to know outside. I've not interacted with people in the agency. 
> 
> SEN MURRAY
> 
> If you're confirmed day one, what will you do about that? 
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 
> 
> Senator, I'm going to assess it as day one. I'm going to understand what the resources the whole NIH needs and make sure that the scientists that are working at the NIH have the resources to do the life-saving work that they do and that the scientists that are supported by the NIH also have that. 
> 
> The personnel decisions are hard to talk about unless I'm actually confirmed, and I have more data.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:41:10 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Please let me finish. What I mean is that I don't know where that goes. I think that that a lot of it likely goes to the things that are worthwhile. And I've heard lots of folks, including from Stanford, who say that. And I agree with them. Support for buildings, light bulbs to make sure that we can see in the lab. 
> 
> And a whole host of other important things. But there's a lot of distrust about where the money goes because the trust in the public health establishment has collapsed in the pandemic. I think transparency regarding Indirect cost is absolutely worthwhile. 
> 
> And it's just something that universities can fix by working together to make sure that where that money goes is made clear. I want to make sure that the money goes to the research.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:45:43 SEN COLLINS
> 
> Will you work immediately to rectify and reverse course on having a one-size-fits-all 15% cap on indirect costs?
> 
> 10:45:57 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Senator, if confirmed, I absolutely commit to following the law, to addressing this issue very directly. 
> 
> I think that this is one of these issues to me, it's an indicator of distrust that that some have of universities and of the scientific process. And so I want to make sure that we address those concerns as well. 
> 
> But I absolutely commit to following the law and I'll consult with agency counsel immediately and work with you, senator, as we spoke of in our meeting to make sure that your concerns are addressed as well.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:47:55 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Absolutely, senator. For me, it's not just a theoretical issue, although I have studied it in my research work. 
> 
> I believe very fundamentally that there are very promising potential ways to prevent Alzheimer's that have not received support, including from some colleagues of mine at Stanford University, because they haven't aligned with a single dominant narrative about what causes Alzheimer's. 
> 
> I want to expand the set of things that we look at as a possible cause for Alzheimer's so that we can make advances. We should have had, I think, much more advances for the investments we've made to date. And I want to make sure that all the hypotheses that are out there get addressed because it's a vitally important problem, as you say, not just humanitarian. Not just for health, but also for the fiscal health of our country.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:55:37 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Yeah, I mean, there's a whole set of projects, senator, that have focused by the NIH on a particular hypothesis, the amyloid hypothesis at the expense of other hypotheses. 
> 
> I agree with you about humility. That's the key to scientific progress. We have to, as scientists say, we might be wrong. Because when we meet data that disagrees with us, where we have ideas that we disagree with, maybe that other idea is right and we're the one that's wrong. 
> 
> It's only by, if I'm confirmed as NIH director, I want to make sure that all the range of hypotheses are supported. That's how you make progress. 
> 
> One of the reasons I think that we have not made progress in Alzheimer's as much as we ought to have is because we've gotten, the NIH has not supported a sufficiently wide range of hypotheses.
> 
> ...
> 
> 11:00:38 SEN HASSAN 
> 
> If directed by the president to take action that would break the law, would you follow the law or would you follow the president's directive? 
> 
> BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Senator, I don't believe the president will ever ask me to break the law. 
> 
> SEN HASSAN Well, that strains credulity given especially the last few weeks. And it's a disappointing answer. I will expect you to follow the law regardless of whether the president directs you to break it.
> 
> ...
> 
> 11:01:32 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Senator, first, I absolutely commit to following the law just in response to the previous question
> 
> ...
> 
> 11:06:43 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Senator, I should say I have a background as an economist as well as being a doctor. And to me, that background, what it leads me to do is understand that every dollar wasted on a frivolous study is a dollar not spent, every dollar wasted on administrative costs that are not needed, is a dollar not spent on research. 
> 
> The team I'm going to put together is going to be hyper-focused to make sure that the portfolio of grants that the NIH funds is devoted to the chronic disease problems of this country. 
> 
> It's going to be devoted to making sure we have not just incremental progress, but research projects that have the capacity to make huge advances in treatment for cancer, for diabetes, for obesity. 
> 
> That's how I'm going to decide what the team is. And the NIH, actually, I'm blessed in some ways because it already has so many excellent scientists there to advise me on the areas I don't know about. 
> 
> And I want to tap that resource. I want to make sure I talk to every single person who's already a leader at the NIH to understand where those opportunities are.
> 
> ...
> 
> 11:08:35 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Senator, first of all, I want to make sure that-- and I want to work with the Congress to make sure that there's appropriate regulation of any risky research. 
> 
> The NIH to have-- I don't think should be doing any research that has the potential to cause a pandemic. 
> 
> And I want to work with Congress to make sure that happens.
> 
> ...
> 
> 11:08:50 BHATTACHARYA
> 
>  As far as trust, I think the key thing is we have to be utterly open if I'm confirmed, I'll be the head of an organization that's a scientific organization. 
> 
> As a citizen, I would often look for FOIA responses from the NIH, Freedom of Information Act requests. And they'd be fully redacted during the pandemic. 
> 
> You can't have trust unless you are transparent. And as if I'm confirmed as NIH director, I fully commit to making sure that the American people can see all of the activities of the NIH openly with limited sort of obfuscation.
> 
> ...
> 
> 11:11:59 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Senator, I don't know that it would take a new system necessarily. 
> 
> I think the key thing is, as you said, senator, the transparency, right? 
> 
> Audits of university spending of indirect costs would help, I think, help inform decisions. It's a complicated question. 
> 
> Of course, I wasn't involved in the decision about the cap. But if I'm confirmed as NIH director, that's something I'll look very carefully at.
> 
> ...
> 
> 11:19:55 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Senator, thank you for that question. I am tremendously proud to have been involved in advising the Florida response to the pandemic. 
> 
> One of the things I was actually involved in the case that resulted in the Florida of kids being able to go back to school. So even as my kids were left out of school, basically not allowed to go back into the school buildings for a year and a half, the kids of Florida were allowed. 
> 
> And as a result, the results are so much better. Florida has a lower all-cause excess death rate during the pandemic than California did. 
> 
> So I think Florida's response to the pandemic was tremendous success. But I'm really glad you highlighted the role of censorship and restriction of scientific discussion. 
> 
> It was so refreshing to me to be allowed to speak my scientific views in Florida during the pandemic. I think the root problem, it's a pandemic is a very difficult thing. So many people are going to have different ideas in an environment of uncertainty. 
> 
> Problem was that people who had alternative ideas were suppressed. I personally was subject to censorship by the actions of the Biden administration during the pandemic. 
> 
> For science to succeed, needs free speech. It needs an environment where there's tolerance for dissent. And the reason I think why Florida did so well was that it provided an outlet for that dissent so that the government of Florida, the state of Florida could adopt the best ideas. 
> 
> It's not that no mistakes were ever made. You can't say that of any state in a pandemic. But in order to do well, you have to allow people to speak with each other openly, even when the ideas are controversial. 
> 
> And so much have we discussed and what you want to bring to bear, I believe, is taking publications or studies And having those replicated.
> 
> ...
> 
> 11:26:48 SEN KIM
> 
> And do you have a view on long COVID? 
> 
> BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Senator, I think it's a problem that affects millions of Americans that we need answers. 
> 
> SEN KIM
> 
> Is this something worth NIH funding? 
> 
> BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Yes. 
> 
> SEN KIM You had a quote before that I was concerned about. You said, quote, there are more pressing health needs for the 1.1 billion that the NIH will spend on long COVID. Is that something you still stand by, that quote? 
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 
> 
> Senator, I think that the funds that have been spent to date on long COVID have not provided answers to the millions of patients. I think that they deserve answers. We need to do a better job with the funds we spend at the NIH so that it actually produces better diagnostics, better cures, better prevention.
> 
> ...
> 
> 11:39:19 SEN HAWLEY
> 
> Let me just ask you the same to make sure we're all on the same page here. Do you support that policy? Will you prohibit the use of abortive fetal tissue in NIH research, NIH-funded research?
> 
> BHATTACHARYA
> 
> I will absolutely follow the lead of Secretary Kennedy and President Trump on this. 
> 
> Just very quickly may say why it's so important that we have alternatives. Because during the pandemic, I would often be on Catholic radio, and people would ask me whether the mRNA vaccines were made or develop with fetal cell lines, I had to say yes. And they had a lot of the folks who were calling in had ethical objections. 
> 
> In public health, we need to make sure the products of the science are ethically acceptable to everybody. And so having alternatives that are not ethically conflicted fetal stem cell lines is not just an ethical issue, but it's a public health issue. We need to make sure that everyone is willing to take the kinds of progress that we make. And so I'm absolutely committed to that.
> 
> ...
> 
> 11:44:29 SEN ALSOBROOKS
> 
> That brings me to a quick line of questioning I have. I want to sound the alarm that some very dangerous things are happening to scientists and researchers at NIH right now and I want to ask you whether you believe that it is appropriate, and you mentioned a moment ago about a concept around knowledge and freedom for scientists, and whether you believe it is appropriate under any circumstance to retaliate against scientists or medical researchers based on the research they have done. Do you believe that? 
> 
> BHATTACHARYA
> 
> No, Senator, I've been subject to that myself. I know what it's like to be subject of devastating takedowns by top officials at the NIH specifically, and I will never do that. I absolutely commit to making sure that scientists are treated respectfully, especially those that disagree with me.
> 
> ...
> 
> 11:49:38 BHATTACHARYA
> 
> Well, racial disparities are important to identify, but the more important is to address the health needs of every American, no matter whether they're minorities or not.

> 02:32:03 PM
> 
> SIEGEL: To provide many more doses of the shot in Texas, though he continues to believe at the same time in personal choice, he says, most of the people impacted are part of the Mennonite community, including an unvaccinated little girl who tragically died.
> 
> KENNEDY:
> 
> In highly unvaccinated communities like the Mennonites, it's something that we recommend. 
> 
> But we also understand, you know, there's a lot of mistrust of the vaccines in that community (TRANSITION) and there are people who cannot be, who should not be vaccinated in the community because they have autoimmune disease or other immune problems.
> 
> And if you do get vaccinated, you're protecting those people from a possible spread.
> 
> SIEGEL: 
> 
> He says, a startling 108 patients were treated in Texas in the last 48 hours, and that therapies, such as the use of cod liver oil which contains vitamin A and D are working.
> 
> He says, the sudden resignation of HHS employee Thomas Corry was not over a clash about the outbreak as reported by Politico.
> 
> KENNEDY:
> 
> I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated, and so they may have made up a story to explain their termination, and then, you know, quit before he got that news.
> 
> So-- but I don't know anything about him. As I said, I've never met him.
> 
> SIEGEL:
> 
> Secretary Kennedy, inspired by his father's commitment to public health for all Americans, as he related to me, plans to focus on improving the Indian Health Service.
> 
> KENNEDY:
> 
> Indian Health Service has been the red-headed stepchild of the of HHS. It's chronically underfunded. It usually receives about 30% of what it really needs.
> 
> SIEGEL:
> 
> Kennedy is also calling for transparency, more studies on vaccines and accurate reporting of vaccine injury.

## HHS statement on supporting Texas measles response

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Department of Health and Human Services
- **Date:** received March 3, 2025

> “The measles outbreak is a top priority for Secretary Kennedy as he noted in this op-ed Sunday,” said Senior Counselor and Principal Deputy Chief of Staff Stefanie Spear. “The CDC is actively supporting Texas state health officials and will be on the ground Tuesday working with the frontline health care providers.  
> 
> “As Kennedy said in his op-ed, ‘The measles outbreak in Texas is a call to action for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to public health. By working together -- parents, healthcare providers, community leaders, and government officials, we can prevent future outbreaks and protect the health of our nation. Under my leadership, HHS is and will always be committed to radical transparency to regain the public’s trust in its health agencies.’”
