> Mehmet Oz, CMS [00:02:42]
> 
> Those countries in Europe, Asia have negotiated more effectively than the American government has been able to negotiate for the American people. 
> 
> And so if you let the private sector do things, they'll try to make money. You know, that's what they're hired to do. And sometimes they'll make more money in one area than another, depending on how well folks are negotiating.
> 
> Right now, we have a crisis in America. Two thirds of Americans who are going into bankruptcy, go bankrupt because of healthcare issues, like the price of medications. In fact, the medications are so expensive for so many Americans that about a third of the time patients aren't able to take their medications. 
> 
> What is it like to be able to know you've got health at the tip of your fingertips? If you can just get it from the pharmacy, but you actually can't afford to get the help? 
> 
> The trade off we're asking the American people to make is you want to be healthy or do you want to be bankrupt? It's your choice. Right? And so that, unfortunately, that's not a good option, especially when you've got members of your family who desperately need these meds. 
> 
> So that creates a tremendous amount of pressure on the pharmaceutical sector. They don't want to be vilified. They don't want to be the bad guys.
> 
> So that the president said, he's a great negotiator, I don't know of a better one, is go out and talk to these guys. 
> 
> We met, and we have already been approached, by a half a dozen of these companies, that they want to talk. They know this is not right. 
> 
> The question is, how do we correct-- what everyone is in agreement-- can be done better. Can we come up with better solutions? 
> 
> Again, we don't want to hurt the industry or destroy the industry. Just want to do something that's fair for the American people.

- **Date:** occurred May 15, 2025

> MARK HARTMAN, FDA 00:44:48
>  
> We talked about GRAS, did a very nice job identifying the main issues that have been identified by stakeholders with the GRAS program, transparency, having a federal entity approve new substances before they enter the food supply, and also the question of what exactly is the nature of the universe of chemicals currently in the food supply that have been self-affirmed over time and how do we go about trying to answer those questions?
> 
> Secretary Kennedy in one of his first, I call it the first programmatic announcement he made, was actually directing FDA to explore rulemaking to address these issues and we are actively in the process of doing just that. And we're making good progress in that regard.
> 
> As we continue to watch what's happening on the Hill and happening in different state capitals, we're focused on carrying out that part of our mission.
> 
> …
> 
> MARK HARTMAN, FDA 00:45:45
>  
> A couple of weeks ago, you may have seen a press conference where Secretary Kennedy and Dr. Makary  also announced the approach we have for synthetic dyes, which I think were also mentioned on the last panel.
> 
> So we're front and center in carrying out many of those items that were announced then, including initiating the process for revoking the authorizations for Orange B and Citrus Red 2, one of which was correctly said has not been certified for quite some time. 
> 
> We still think it's really important to go ahead and clean up those regulations as part of a kind of comprehensive approach to addressing these color additives.
> 
> At the same time, we are working with industry to encourage elimination and phasing out of the remaining synthetic color additives.
> 
> Almost every day there's a new announcement from someone in the food industry getting on board with this approach. Tyson Foods, I think it's the most recent one.
> 
> I think we'll continue to see different companies stepping into that space and taking up the challenge to make that transition.
> 
> And during any time of change, it's really important that we also focus some of our attention and resources on clearing the path for alternatives to those color additives in the marketplace.
> 
> Secretary Kennedy announced that we were going to be complete four of those reviews this summer. We already completed three of them that were announced last week. We're well on the way of completing at least one more in the near future.
> 
> And we're going to continue to look at ways to look at our process to make sure we're as efficient as we can be in conducting those reviews. And prioritizing those reviews as we continue to work with folks to try to move out of the synthetic color additives.
> 
> …
> 
> MARK HARTMAN, FDA 00:48:14
> 
> Last but not least, in the post-market space, some of you will remember that we are, you know, back in the fall, we had a public meeting and issued a process paper that described what would be our systematic process for doing a postmarket review program.
> 
> We got 70,000 comments. Thank you very much. And I think we should, you know-- we need to start talking to people about the late comments. I mean, the last second comments, you know, with 10,000 until the last day and then it's 70,000. We got to go-- People often tell us that we have to move faster. I'm here to tell you, I think the stakeholders need to move faster in their comments. But seriously. 
> 
> So, I mean, again, looking for an approach to systematically look at the universe of substances in our food supply, prioritize which ones rise to the level of requiring additional review, risk assessment, and if necessary after that risk assessment, risk management approaches on an ongoing basis over time. 
> 
> And while we're standing up that program, we do have a number of chemical activities that are already in flight. We'll continue to be working those chemicals that are already listed on our website as chemicals that we've been working on either because they are or we're – we were petitioned to take some action or otherwise identified as priorities.
> 
> And there's supposed to be breaking news today, so I'm going to announce it anyway, even though the press announcement hasn't gone out. So I'm taking a risk here. No-- not really. It’s already-- but as soon as today and maybe tomorrow, we'll be putting out an announcement on some of our progress on the post market review program to include, we talked about prioritization, we’ve developed a draft prioritization schema that we're going to be releasing for public comment and peer review. We expect that to be happening in the coming weeks.
> 
> In addition to that, we are going to—we  plan on updating that process paper I talked about and having to finalize that process based on comments that we received and have that ready later this year, as well as updating that list of chemicals that I talked about that we're currently working on to include BHT, make sure I get them right, BHA and ADA will be added in addition to others.
> 
> Now, that won't be happening today, but we're in the process of getting ready to do an update to that list. So there's a lot of activity in the post-market space.
> 
> …
> 
> MARK HARTMAN, FDA 00:55:38
> 
> Now, so, identifying a chemical to go through this process is step one.
> 
> Step two is actually going through the scientific review and assessment of the hazard and exposure associated with that chemical. 
> 
> So, I mean, just because something shows up on a list of things that we're focusing on does not necessarily mean there's an outcome down the line. I mean, we don't look at it that way.
> 
> And, do you work for General Mills? I was going to say, because one of my-- I have three kids. My middle son has never-- he's always been an odd eater. And one of the things he will eat is Cheerios.
> 
> And he is very aware of when they are stale and he has—his version of stale is like they've been open for a day. So, you know, so I have personal stake in making sure that both that they're safe and also that we assess them appropriately.

> Martin Makary, FDA [00:33:41]
> 
> So on June 4th, as a part of a series of new round tables that we're going to convene, we can do them quick. We can get the top experts from around the world. We don't go through the bureaucracy of a FACA.
> 
> And we convene experts, and we're going to do one on infant formula with the top infant formula experts around the country. It's going to be public and available and media welcome to come. If there's any media here, you're welcome. 
> 
> On June 4th, we're doing one on menopause and hormone replacement therapy for too long. Women have not gotten the research and evidence that they deserve around some of these giant topics where there's been a lot of misinformation. 
> 
> Peanut allergies were rare two generations ago. It's now extremely common. Why? What's going on? The cumulative burden of all these molecules that don't appear in nature that are going down the GI tract, it's doing something, it's creating some inflammation or immune response, and maybe it's triggering autoimmune diseases. I don't know.
> 
> But why are do one in five to one in six women have an autoimmune disease. And it was rare two generations ago? We can't keep going down the path of drugging our population at scale. 
> 
> The best way to lower drug prices are to stop taking drugs we don't need. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Martin Makary, FDA [00:34:59]
> 
> And so that's why we announced the removal-- the plan to remove petroleum, all petroleum based food dyes from the U.S. food supply, ideally by the beginning of school year next year, we'd like to see that.
> 
> We're meeting with companies. Danone just made a big announcement. Thank you, Danone. We're meeting with many of these companies. A lot of them have been terrific. They're saying, we just want a common national standard and timeframes. So our competitors don't have an unfair advantage. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Martin Makary, FDA [00:39:19]
> 
> We want to be very transparent and we want to create a framework for vaccine makers, that they can use, so they have a predictable FDA where they don't have to worry, how is this going to be received? 
> 
> And so we are talking openly about this. We're doing a lot of interviews. We're doing a lot of fireside chats. And Dr. Vinay Prasad who's the head of CBER is planning to sort of unleash a massive framework so that all the companies will know exactly what we're thinking. 
> 
> And probably in the coming days.
> 
> He just started and we have-- he has been doing a lot of meetings and meetings with industry and also meetings with the staff at CBER. 
> 
> He also believes in gold standard science and common sense, especially when it comes to rare diseases. We've had these conversations. 
> 
> He is bringing the perspective of a hematologist, where some of these drugs that have been approved. We don't know if it influences overall survival. That doesn't mean they shouldn't be available to patients. We both believe in both the letter and the spirit of right to try, but we should also be looking in post-approval monitoring about what's actually going on. Is there a safety signal we didn't see in the trial? And is there a benefit that we didn't see in the trial? 
> 
> We've never been able to do that before, but now with big data, we are assembling some of the biggest electronic health record databases. And, we will be able to query those databases in real time, as soon as we approve a drug. And that will also influence our decision as to when to green light something, because if we have eyes on it, the second it's approved, we can feel more confident about understanding safety signals.

## RFK Jr. at House hearing on budget request

- **Source:** livestream
- **Attribution:** House Appropriations Committee
- **Date:** broadcasted May 14, 2025

> 10:06:01  KENNEDY: Let me address your first issue first, because I want to correct you. We have about 1,100 measles cases in this country. The growth rate last year was 15 additional, so we have plateaued.
> 
> Mexico has roughly the same number with a third of our population, and they got 300 extra cases last week. Canada has more measles, 1,500, they have one eighth of our population.
> 
> Western Europe has about 6,000 which is 10 times the number that we have. So you are wrong about earlier.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:10:26  KENNEDY: We have under the reorganization, and I'm going to talk very, very broadly, because as of four o'clock yesterday afternoon, we are under a court order not to do any further planning on the reorganization. And I've been advised by my attorneys not to talk about it.
> 
> But I will just say broadly, many of the programs that the Democrats are now saying were cut at CDC were not cut at all. Those programs were transferred to the Administration for a Healthy America.
> 
> But I'm not allowed-- I'm not permitted to talk in any more detail because of a court order.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:24:52  KENNEDY: They were made-- I mean, ultimately we executed the decisions.
> 
> HOYER: I know you executed them, but my question is--
> 
> KENNEDY: Elon Musk gave us help in trying-- in figuring out where there was waste, fraud, and abuse in the department. But it was up to me to make the decision. And there are many instances where I pushed back and said, we don't want to-- that would hurt us to eliminate that group.
> 
> HOYER: Let me ask you a question based upon that response. Was there an analysis of the consequences of these cuts, and the reduction in force and elimination of programs, was there an analysis that you can provide the committee that indicated those, as you concluded in your statement, would not harm people, would not undermine, frankly, the people not served, children not educated, research not accomplished, frankly, lives not saved. Is there an analysis that you can provide to this committee prior to us, determining the budget, that will show that in fact those cuts will not be harmful to those objectives?
> 
> KENNEDY: I mean, there were analysis. The simplest analysis was at the outset, the analysis that we're spending 2 trillion dollars a year that we don't have. Mr. Musk said he was going to cut the two trillion dollars more than you have. You have to make cuts.
> 
> The other analysis that was more detailed--
> 
> HOYER: Is that the children or the Indians that you're so concerned about?
> 
> KENNEDY: We didn't cut the Indians. We didn't cut the Indian services--
> 
> HOYER: I understand you. I'm asking you--
> 
> KENNEDY: I made sure that those services were not cut. I made sure that Head Start was not cut.
> 
> And-- but the cuts that were done were cuts that were to duplication, to redundancy, to streamlining. 
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:34:40  KENNEDY: If you had a child today, would you vaccinate for measles?
> 
> For measles? Um-- probably for measles. I-- you know, what I would say is my opinions about vaccines are irrelevant.
> 
> I have directed Jay Bhattacharya--
> 
> POCAN: Like I said--
> 
> KENNEDY: So that everybody could make that decision. But I don't want to seem like I'm being evasive. 
> 
> I don't think people should be taking advice, medical advice from me.
> 
> POCAN: Right, I got that. And I'm not asking you to give them medical advice, but would you vaccinate your child for measles? 
> 
> KENNEDY: I think if I answer that question directly, that it will seem like I'm giving advice to other people and I don't want to be doing that. 
> 
> I want people to make up their own--
> 
> POCAN: But that's kind of your jurisdiction, because CDC does give advice, right? I'm not trying to do it as a gotcha.
> 
> KENNEDY: I think what we're going to try to do is to lay out the pros and cons, the risks and benefits, accurately as we understand them, with replicable studies.
> 
> POCAN: Can you talk about chickenpox? Would you vaccinate your child against chickenpox?
> 
> KENNEDY: I-- again, I don't want to give advice.
> 
> I can tell you in Europe, they don't use the chickenpox vaccine specifically, because the preclinical trial shows that when you innoculate the population from chickenpox, you get shingles in older people, which is more dangerous.
> 
> POCAN: Just one last one, just a yes or now please, if we could, polio.
> 
> KENNEDY: Polio? Again, I don't want to be giving advice.
> 
> ...
> 
> 10:52:06  KENNEDY: I reinstated 328 employees at NIOSH, about a little over a third of them were in Morgantown, and about a third in Cincinnati, and the World Trade Center group also reinstated.
> 
> MOORE: Well, thank you for that. The black lung screening program, and the coal workers health surveillance program, are particularly important to West Virginia. My understanding is that the coal workers health surveillance program at NIOSH will be fully reinstated. Is that correct?
> 
> KENNEDY: Yes, the program will continue to function with continuity.
> 
> ...
> 
> 11:07:21  KENNEDY: We are about to reissue the dietary guidelines and we're going to do it very quickly. We have until January, but we're going to do it. 
> 
> I think we'll have it done even before August. 
> 
> And we took the Biden guidelines, which were 453 pages long and were clearly written by industry, that are incomprehensible, driven by the same industry capture and those kind of carnal impulses that put Froot Loops at the top of the food pyramid. And we are changing that. 
> 
> So we're going to have four page dietary guidelines that tell people essentially eat whole food, eat the food that's good for you. 
> 
> That's going to drive changes in the school lunch programs. And we're going to need your help to make sure we can get good school lunches to Head Start. 
> 
> I've been touring these Head Start facilities. Everything they eat is in a package. And it is loaded with sugar and with chemicals.
> 
> ...
> 
> 11:17:59  KENNEDY: What happened to many of those children is just horrific. 
> 
> They were being-- my predecessor was deliberately employing a policy of speed over safety. So they waived all of the identification requirements for sponsors. Sponsors were not required to show valid identification. They were never fingerprinted. So we didn't know if they had criminal records. There was no DNA testing. So their claims that they were taking a family member were 
> 
> CLYDE: Dubious at best?
> 
> KENNEDY: Yeah, they were dubious. In Cleveland, according to the grand jury testimony and the grand jury findings in Florida, there are so many episodes. One of them is a man in Cleveland who picked up a 16-year-old girl claiming to be her brother, raped her, impregnated her, put her in a home where she was being regularly raped of all men. And then got a 16-year-old boy who disappeared. And went back two other times for other children.
> 
> This was happening again and again. One agency placed 592 children with 120 sponsors. 400 children were shipped to a town, where there's a meat packing plant in Kansas, 400 children who, you know, they had to come and claim that they -- the sponsors had to claim that those children lived in that town.
> 
> And we've seen a fake ID where you have one guy who is photoshopped in with a whole bunch of different children and he's showing up and picking up at these kids one at a time. The Biden administration knew about it. They saw the same pictures we did, and they did nothing. 
> 
> There's 160,000 help complaints that were never investigated. I've launched now a criminal task force. We've opened up 500 criminal investigations and already brought 80 to court. So we are going to try to do everything we can. We're working with DHS to find these children.
> 
> But the federal government under the Biden administration became the biggest facilitator for child abuse probably in the history, certainly in the history, of our country.
> 
> CLYDE: Well, thank you. I was going to ask you, how are you going to hold these contractors and officials accountable, but I think you answered that question already.
> 
> KENNEDY: We're already doing fingerprinting on every sponsor. We're doing DNA testing on every sponsor. We're doing income testing on every sponsor and we're doing valid ID testing. 
> 
> Nobody gets a kid without showing that they are a family member.

> For too long, Americans have been subsidizing prescription drugs for other nations. That ends under President Trump and Secretary Kennedy’s leadership. Unlike the previous administration, this one is committed to keeping pharmaceutical manufacturers from charging Americans high drug prices while giving steep discounts to other wealthy nations. As noted in the executive order, HHS will be establishing a mechanism through which Americans can buy pharmaceuticals directly from manufacturers and, if manufacturers fail to offer most-favored-nation pricing, the Secretary will propose, through rule making, rules to impose most-favored-nation pricing along with other measures to ensure lower prices for Americans.
> 
> For your reporting purposes, I’d also like to direct you to the fact sheet which provides more details about this initiative.

## HHS spokesperson on FDA's unapproved fluoride action

- **Source:** emailed statement

- **Date:** received May 13, 2025

> HHS and the FDA are taking bold action to protect America’s children by initiating the removal of unapproved, ingestible fluoride prescription drug products from the market. These fluoride prescription drug products, given to infants and toddlers, have never been approved by the FDA and pose real risks to developing children — including harm to the gut microbiome, potential thyroid dysfunction, weight gain, and even reduced IQ. This is not just a public health issue — it’s a moral issue.
> 
> The American people deserve transparency and accountability. HHS and FDA are launching a full safety review, with public input, and aim to finalize action by October 31. The Department will issue new guidelines promoting safe, effective dental hygiene without compromising gut health.
> 
> This marks another step toward delivering on our Make America Healthy Again promise—by ending outdated practices and putting Gold Standard Science at the center of children’s health.

> The FDA has not found sodium fluoride chewable tablets to be safe and effective, and the labeling for these products has not been approved by the FDA.
> 
> This means that while these tablets are available by prescription, they have not gone through the FDA's rigorous approval process to ensure safety and efficacy.
> 
> The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy notes that no fluoride products designed for ingestion have been approved by the FDA, with the exception of topical products like toothpaste.
> 
> Sodium fluoride chewable tablets are considered "unapproved drugs".
> 
> It's important to note that even though these tablets are not FDA-approved, they are still available by prescription from a dentist or doctor, particularly for children at high risk of tooth decay in areas with low fluoride in the drinking water.

> 
> Well, the president wants equalization. That's the word that he used and it's mostly about fairness. 
> 
> So over the next 30 days, we are approaching all the major pharmaceutical companies and saying this is what your drugs costs in other countries that are similar to ours. 
> 
> We want most favored nation status, which means, very specifically, if you're willing to sell, as President Trump's anecdote about a portly friend of his was getting a GLP drug in London said, I can get it for $88 here. I've got to pay a thousand dollars in America. That doesn't seem fair. 
> 
> And so most pharmaceutical companies, I believe, and they're gonna hear from us over the next few weeks are understand that this is not really right for America, that to generate 70% of their profits, and we're only 4% of the world population. 
> 
> So we believe there's going to be a desire to come to an understanding. And you see from the stock prices on pharmaceutical companies that others may think this is also okay for that sector. 
> 
> My belief is that if we can't get this to the right place in 30 days, there are tactics we can use. They exist already within government. The president has some opportunities. Congress obviously has options.
> 
> But the best case scenario would be all-- we all get along and say, 'hey, listen, this is something that you, as an American, probably don't think is right either. How do we get Europe to pay a little more? So America can pay a little less?'
> 
> And that is exactly what I think the pharmaceutical shareholders will be okay with, because they're going to make the same amount of money, just not all of it from the U.S.

> I think it will stick Rob. And the reason I think it'll stick is because I think the pharmaceutical companies know that it's time.
> 
> And we've been meeting with them and, you know, this was not a surprise to them. 
> 
> I had meetings with most of the CEOs last week and I gave them at least a veiled warning that this was coming, but they knew it was coming. 
> 
> And one of the things that they really want is to get rid of the middle men, to get rid of the pharmaceutical benefit managers, the PBMs who collect a lot of the money and don't produce anything. 
> 
> They're supposed to bargain for better prices, but there's all kinds of ways that they can make money on it. 
> 
> And it's been a thorn in the side or a stone in the shoe of the pharmaceutical companies for years. 
> 
> And one of the things that we did with this, with this executive order, is to allow-- is to eliminate the PBMs in these transactions. 
> 
> So I think that's something, that's a carrot for the pharmaceutical companies. And then, there's a stick too.

> 
> I'm very, very happy and grateful President Trump for nominating Casey as the surgeon general. 
> 
> There -- the industries that are threatened by her nomination are mobilizing and they're actually paying a lot of bloggers, we've learned now, to attack her. They're attacking her on mainly on the critique that she stopped practicing medicine. 
> 
> Casey was at the top of her Stanford class. She was president of her Stanford class. As a resident, she won every award that you could get for the kind of surgery that she was doing. But she realized very early on that she was not healing patients. They were coming back again and again, because the surgeries were treating the symptoms and not the underlying causes. 
> 
> And she decided to devote her life to figuring out what those underlying causes were. And to ending those exposures.

- **Date:** received May 12, 2025

> “We should look at every avenue to get drug companies to lower list prices. Americans are getting ripped off paying the highest prescription drug prices of any nation, and that is why America’s PBMs have repeatedly called on big drug companies to lower their prices. PBMs are the only ones whose mission is to lower prescription drug costs and the only check against drug companies’ unlimited pricing power, negotiating lower costs where competition exists.
> 
> PCMA commends President Trump for rightfully recognizing the price is the problem. We encourage the Administration to work with us to harness the power of PBMs’ work lowering costs as we all push to lower prescription drug prices for the American people.”

And we have to make sure that we don't ever use this agency to conduct research that puts the American people in danger the way that the research on gain function, that the previous sort of leadership of the agency sponsored, we have to make sure that that never happens again.

> One of the problems that we've had at CDC and NIH and FDA has been a kind of data chaos, and particularly around the issue of autism where they don't even-- don't not only-- not only do they not understand and they can't tell us the etiology, the origins of why are we having an epidemic, but they deny an epidemic exists. 
> 
> And even though every year the numbers go up, we've gone one in 10,000 in 1970, to one in every 31 kids today. In California, which has the best database, it is one in every 20 children. One in every 12.5 boys.
> 
> This is an existential disease. Every other disease like this has a registry. So that -- and it's voluntary -- so that public health officials can monitor the numbers. 
> 
> It's not private information. It's not information that is going to go out to other agencies. 
> 
> It's a voluntary system where your privacy is protected. Just a system for keeping track of a disease that is now becoming debilitating to the American people.

> 
> Guided by President Trump’s Executive Order, the Department's restructuring is focused on cutting wasteful bureaucracy, eliminating duplicative administrative roles, and allowing HHS to redirect resources where they’re most needed—delivering better outcomes for the American people.
> 
> As part of the standard union negotiated process, HHS issued specific notice on Friday to approximately 700 employees, who were previously notified of a RIF. These notices provide important details to employees including their full information, giving them important information about their planned offboarding date set for July.
> 
> After careful review, less than 250 employees across HHS were notified that they are also impacted by the reduction in force announced in March 2025. [...] The savings from these reductions will help redirect resources toward critical programs and strengthen our ability to serve the American people effectively. The goal is clear: reduce waste and maximize the impact of every taxpayer dollar. 
> 
> The simple fact is that the important work of serving the American people will continue without disruption. Because of the reorganization, HHS will be better positioned to meet the needs of those who count on us most.

At the same time, we recognize that some individuals and communities across the U.S. may choose not to vaccinate. Our commitment is to support all families—regardless of their vaccination status—in reducing the risk of hospitalization, serious complications, and death from measles. 
> 
> Secretary Kennedy will be enlisting the entire agency to activate a scientific process to treat a host of diseases, including measles, with single or multiple existing drugs in combination with vitamins and other modalities. This effort will involve collaboration with universities nationwide to develop protocols, conduct testing, and pursue approval for new uses of safe and effective therapeutics that meet the highest scientific standards.

> Generation Gold Standard marks a critical step in restoring strategic focus and radical transparency to America’s pandemic preparedness. Developed entirely by government scientists—free from industry influence—the BPL vaccine platform could provide broad, long-lasting protection against all influenza viral pathogens, including influenza and coronaviruses, with the added potential to block transmission and stop outbreaks at the source.

> This initiative realigns BARDA with its core mission: preparing for all flu viral pathogens, not just COVID-19. It delivers a cost-effective, accountable alternative to the Biden administration’s wasteful Project NextGen, which spent $1.63 billion on COVID-19 vaccines and $1.19 billion on therapeutics, neglecting broader pandemic preparedness.

## HHS spokesperson's reply to question about updated COVID vaccines for the winter

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson
- **Date:** received May 1, 2025

> Secretary Kennedy’s HHS has pledged radical transparency to the American public. This means being honest and straightforward about what we know — and what we don’t know — about medical products, including vaccines. The CDC’s former practice of suppressing information about vaccine injuries has badly eroded trust in our public health agencies.
>  
> Under Secretary Kennedy’s leadership, all new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure — a radical departure from past practices. Except for the COVID vaccine, none of the vaccines on the CDC’s childhood recommended schedule was tested against an inert placebo, meaning we know very little about the actual risk profiles of these products.
>  
> The CDC’s own research has shown that the post-licensure surveillance system, VAERS, captures fewer than 1% of vaccine injuries. It’s a system that was designed to fail. The Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) — intended as a backup to VAERS — is virtually unusable for serious research. Both systems have become templates of regulatory malpractice.
>  
> HHS is now building surveillance systems that will accurately measure vaccine risks as well as benefits — because real science demands both transparency and accountability.
