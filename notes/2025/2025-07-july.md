<br>To: FDA-Wide
<br>Subject: Calendar Year 2024 Performance Management Appraisal Program (PMAP) Award Guidance
> 
> Calendar Year 2024 Performance Management Appraisal Program 
> (PMAP) Award Guidance 
> To: All FDA Employees 
> ACTION REQUESTED: FDA employees with a 2024 performance rating of 3.1 or higher must select their 
> PMAP award preference (cash, time-off, or combination) within 3 business days of this guidance's 
> email issuance via the ePMAP Tool (NLT COB Friday, July 11th), or a cash award will be given by default. 
> Only employees who are not scheduled to separate, via voluntary or involuntary program, will be eligible 
> to receive a PMAP Award. Ratings determine eligibility and limits for award types in accordance with FDA 
> guidance below. Detailed instructions on choosing your award type is available here: Employee Award 
> Finalization. If you have already selected your award type, your selection is final and you may not 
> request to change it. 
> Performance Awards Pools:
>  Employees must have an FDA performance rating to receive a performance award from FDA’s 
> performance award pool. 
>  Employees who separate from the FDA (including but not limited to: retirement, resignation, or 
> reassignment), or convert to Executive or Commissioned Corps appointments before the pay 
> period of the awards payout will NOT receive an award. 
> o Employees on administrative leave due to accepting the Deferred Resignation will NOT 
> be eligible to receive a performance award. 
> o Employees who have received notification that their position is impacted by the 
> Reduction in Force will NOT be eligible to receive a performance award. 
>  Monetary Award Pool Allocations* 
> 2
> AFGE and NTEU Bargaining Unit 
> Employees
> Non-Bargaining Unit Employees
> 85% toward Rating-Based Awards 
> (PMAP Awards) 
> 80% toward Rating-Based Awards 
> (PMAP Awards) 
> 15% toward Incentive Awards 20% toward Incentive Awards 
> *Any remaining cash funds after rating-based awards have been proportionately awarded may be 
> reallocated to the incentive award pool. 
>  Employees may request their award payout preference of either a cash award, time-off award, or 
> combination award. The selection of “combination” will result in the award being equally split 
> between time-off and cash. Employees may visit the FDA Performance Management 
> Program Performance Award Payout Estimator page to calculate their estimated award at the 
> maximum. 
> Performance Awards:
>  Employees with a 3.1 annual rating score and above are eligible for a cash award. 
>  Employees with a 3.0 annual rating score and above are eligible to elect a time-off award in lieu 
> of cash. Employees with an annual rating score of 3.0-3.09 may receive a time-off award but are 
> not eligible for a cash award. 
>  Time off awards will be based on the “cash equivalent value” of the cash award that would have 
> been given as a result of the employee’s annual rating score. If the cash equivalent value exceeds 
> the number of hours available to you, the remainder will be awarded as cash if you are eligible to 
> receive cash. 
>  Time-off awards are limited per employee to 80 hours per single accomplishment/contribution 
> and cannot exceed 100 total award hours in a calendar year. Time-off Awards received through 
> the incentive awards program count against the 100-hour maximum an employee may receive in 
> a single leave year; therefore time-off incentive awards already received before performancebased awards are processed may impact the number of hours an employee may receive as a 
> performance award. Please note time-off awards do not pay out in cash if you separate from FDA 
> prior to using them. 
>  Employees with a 3.1 annual rating score and above are eligible for a combination award. 
>  
> Quality Step Increases (QSIs):
>  A QSI is a faster-than-normal within-grade increase (WGI) used to reward General Schedule (GS) 
> employees, including Title 38 Medical Officers, at any grade level who display high-quality 
> performance.* 
>  Employees who receive an Achieved Outstanding Results (AO) summary rating may be eligible for 
> a QSI. Management will make the determination which employees will be approved to receive a 
> QSI as their rating-based award. 
>  To be eligible for a QSI, employees must: 
> o Be below step 10 of their grade level; 
> o Have received the highest annual rating score of Achieved Outstanding Results (4.5-5.0); 
> 3
> o Have demonstrated sustained performance of high quality; and 
> o Have not received a QSI within the preceding 52 consecutive calendar weeks. 
> Quality Increases (QIs):
>  Title 21 employees who display high-quality performance are eligible for Quality Increases with 
> eligibility consistent with the guidance outlined above for QSIs. 
> Performance Award Pool Tier Levels:
> For each award pool, there will be a consistent percentage used to determine the award value for each 
> tier level. Below are the maximum award percentages for each tier and pool. Please note the payout 
> percentages for both NBUEs and BUEs remain the same as last year. Last year, both AFGE and NTEU 
> decided to allocate more funds towards PMAP awards instead of incentive awards, therefore it was 
> determined the maximum award percentages could increase.
> If sufficient funds (e.g., for “cash equivalent” purposes) are not available using the maximum award 
> percentages for each tier, then the pool will be balanced by reducing the percent payout for all tiers 
> proportionately.

> Hey guys, hope you had a good Fourth of July and a nice break. We had a great workshop today on reducing animal testing and the NAMS, and that's going great. So that was a great event today. Over 1000 folks also live streamed to the public so everybody can see what we're thinking and what we're doing, also on the PMAP performance awards. That has been such a problem, it's been held up, and we finally figured out what the block was, and we were able to fix it. It was a problem deep in the bureaucracy of government, outside of FDA, we were able to fix it, and so people will be getting their PMAP performance awards in the next couple weeks by the first week of August at the latest, I'm told, sorry for the delay. It shouldn't have happened, and I'm just glad it's going to go through. This is for 2024 it's overdue, but wanted to give you a quick update on that. So that's it for now. Thanks again for all your hard work and continue to flag anything for us that we can work on on your behalf. We'll continue to advocate for you.

## Interview with Robert Malone and Retsef Levi

> Robert Malone, ACIP [00:33:22]
> 
> This is just for context. I personally lost two jobs, in the past, working in the influenza industry, influenza vaccine industry, for even raising the issue of negative effectiveness of immune imprinting and of original antigenic sin. 
> 
> The last two being really all three of those being very technical terms that have to do with the issue of whether or not taking this type of product year after year after year is-- makes good sense immunologically, or whether doing this year after year after year is somehow imprinting one's immune system in ways that are, just to simplify it, counterproductive or mounting a effective immune response against a new strain your body may not have encountered in the past.
> 
> Basically, it's as if we're training the army-- you know, you can build a strategy based on the last war and functionally that's what happens with influenza vaccines, is it's teaching your immune system to fight the last war largely. 
> 
> And it-- there are data and it's been a hot subject of debate in the vaccine community now for decades, whether or not, one, this strategy of annual boosting or in the case of the COVID product, much more frequent than annual, is actually counterproductive, that it's driving the immune system towards categories of responses that are counterproductive. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Malone, ACIP [00:35:57]
> 
> Now Retsef is going to chair the COVID subcommittee. So this is super important because it means he's going to be in charge of setting the agenda for what gets discussed about COVID and the various COVID products and how they've been evaluated going forward. 
> 
> He hasn't had that opportunity in the past, but now he does have that. 
> 
> And I find myself having been positioned as chair of the influenza vaccine committee. 
> 
> So I mentioned in the meeting that it's my intention, that these issues of immune imprinting, original antigenic sin, etcetera, will be discussed and strongly considered in upcoming meetings. 
> 
> In terms of the decision that we were faced, we were presented with essentially language that was already approved and had to make a decision about whether or not to endorse both those specific virus strains that had been vetted thoroughly and to endorse a universal influenza vaccine recommendation as has been the case for decades. 
> 
> And the decision was that this was not the time to fight on that hill about the universal influenza vaccine recommendation. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Malone, ACIP [00:49:30]
> 
> There are some that suggests that the COVID products are causing various types of damage to the immune response that's leading to a susceptibility to one of the most common immunologically controlled diseases that we're all familiar with, which is cancer. 
> 
> And so the question came up and I asked it very gently whether the ACIP is tracking these issues, whether they have the data to support or refute these hypotheses. And the answer is no, they don't. 
> 
> So I hope that we as the ACIP going forward, frankly, my impression is that a lot of the thinking at the CDC in terms of these monitoring and analyses routines that they get into are a bit antiquated. 
> 
> They're kind of old school to use common slang. And, I think personally that the CDC will be well served, and so will the public, to start incorporating in their analyses newer frontline concepts about immune response.

## Statement from HHS spokesperson on Dr Vinay Prasad

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson
- **Date:** received July 3, 2025

> The idea that Dr. Prasad “overruled” FDA scientists is a distortion of the facts. He evaluated the totality of the evidence and made a judgment rooted in gold standard science. That’s not political—it’s what principled leadership looks like.
>  
> The reality is that the FDA has never permitted manufacturers to claim COVID-19 vaccines prevent Long Covid, because such a claim is not supported by high-quality evidence. While critics selectively cite fringe fears or speculate, the FDA will continue to follow the science and use evidence-based decision making. No honest scientist can claim that another booster for a healthy young adult meets that standard today.
>  
> Dr. Prasad is pursuing a course correction to bring U.S. policy in line with the rest of the developed world. That correction requires thoughtful review and clear documentation, not blind repetition of outdated frameworks. Dismissing this process as “cherry-picking” ignores the obvious: science evolves, and so must our policies.
>  
> Dr. Makary’s decision to elevate Dr. Prasad reflects the need for coherent, accountable leadership at the top of FDA. The consolidation of titles isn’t political—it’s a long-overdue response to years of fragmented decision-making that often lacked evidence-based judgment. Dr. Prasad’s leadership marks a return to scientific integrity—not a departure from it.
>  
> Let’s also be honest about who the loudest critics are. Many of the same so-called experts being quoted today are the ones who pushed policies that have since collapsed under scrutiny—advising cloth masks for toddlers or insisting that children receive dose after dose of a vaccine with no individualized benefit-risk evaluation. Their record speaks for itself. And if we’re talking about politics in vaccine policy, we should recall the rushed BLA approval under the Biden administration, which triggered mandates for millions—including those who already had COVID—and contributed to unnecessary adverse events like myocarditis. That disastrous move led to the resignation of FDA’s top two vaccine officials and remains one of the most damaging missteps in modern public health history.
>  
> Dr. Prasad is correcting course with data, with transparency, and with the courage to say what others won’t. That’s how trust in science is rebuilt.
