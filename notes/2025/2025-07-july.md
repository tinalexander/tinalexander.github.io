## Statement from HHS spokesperson on Dr Vinay Prasad

> The idea that Dr. Prasad “overruled” FDA scientists is a distortion of the facts. He evaluated the totality of the evidence and made a judgment rooted in gold standard science. That’s not political—it’s what principled leadership looks like.
>  
> The reality is that the FDA has never permitted manufacturers to claim COVID-19 vaccines prevent Long Covid, because such a claim is not supported by high-quality evidence. While critics selectively cite fringe fears or speculate, the FDA will continue to follow the science and use evidence-based decision making. No honest scientist can claim that another booster for a healthy young adult meets that standard today.
>  
> Dr. Prasad is pursuing a course correction to bring U.S. policy in line with the rest of the developed world. That correction requires thoughtful review and clear documentation, not blind repetition of outdated frameworks. Dismissing this process as “cherry-picking” ignores the obvious: science evolves, and so must our policies.
>  
> Dr. Makary’s decision to elevate Dr. Prasad reflects the need for coherent, accountable leadership at the top of FDA. The consolidation of titles isn’t political—it’s a long-overdue response to years of fragmented decision-making that often lacked evidence-based judgment. Dr. Prasad’s leadership marks a return to scientific integrity—not a departure from it.
>  
> Let’s also be honest about who the loudest critics are. Many of the same so-called experts being quoted today are the ones who pushed policies that have since collapsed under scrutiny—advising cloth masks for toddlers or insisting that children receive dose after dose of a vaccine with no individualized benefit-risk evaluation. Their record speaks for itself. And if we’re talking about politics in vaccine policy, we should recall the rushed BLA approval under the Biden administration, which triggered mandates for millions—including those who already had COVID—and contributed to unnecessary adverse events like myocarditis. That disastrous move led to the resignation of FDA’s top two vaccine officials and remains one of the most damaging missteps in modern public health history.
>  
> Dr. Prasad is correcting course with data, with transparency, and with the courage to say what others won’t. That’s how trust in science is rebuilt.
