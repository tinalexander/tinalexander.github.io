> Hey guys, hope you had a good Fourth of July and a nice break. We had a great workshop today on reducing animal testing and the NAMS, and that's going great. So that was a great event today. Over 1000 folks also live streamed to the public so everybody can see what we're thinking and what we're doing, also on the PMAP performance awards. That has been such a problem, it's been held up, and we finally figured out what the block was, and we were able to fix it. It was a problem deep in the bureaucracy of government, outside of FDA, we were able to fix it, and so people will be getting their PMAP performance awards in the next couple weeks by the first week of August at the latest, I'm told, sorry for the delay. It shouldn't have happened, and I'm just glad it's going to go through. This is for 2024 it's overdue, but wanted to give you a quick update on that. So that's it for now. Thanks again for all your hard work and continue to flag anything for us that we can work on on your behalf. We'll continue to advocate for you.

> Robert Malone, ACIP [00:33:22]
> 
> This is just for context. I personally lost two jobs, in the past, working in the influenza industry, influenza vaccine industry, for even raising the issue of negative effectiveness of immune imprinting and of original antigenic sin. 
> 
> The last two being really all three of those being very technical terms that have to do with the issue of whether or not taking this type of product year after year after year is-- makes good sense immunologically, or whether doing this year after year after year is somehow imprinting one's immune system in ways that are, just to simplify it, counterproductive or mounting a effective immune response against a new strain your body may not have encountered in the past.
> 
> Basically, it's as if we're training the army-- you know, you can build a strategy based on the last war and functionally that's what happens with influenza vaccines, is it's teaching your immune system to fight the last war largely. 
> 
> And it-- there are data and it's been a hot subject of debate in the vaccine community now for decades, whether or not, one, this strategy of annual boosting or in the case of the COVID product, much more frequent than annual, is actually counterproductive, that it's driving the immune system towards categories of responses that are counterproductive. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Malone, ACIP [00:35:57]
> 
> Now Retsef is going to chair the COVID subcommittee. So this is super important because it means he's going to be in charge of setting the agenda for what gets discussed about COVID and the various COVID products and how they've been evaluated going forward. 
> 
> He hasn't had that opportunity in the past, but now he does have that. 
> 
> And I find myself having been positioned as chair of the influenza vaccine committee. 
> 
> So I mentioned in the meeting that it's my intention, that these issues of immune imprinting, original antigenic sin, etcetera, will be discussed and strongly considered in upcoming meetings. 
> 
> In terms of the decision that we were faced, we were presented with essentially language that was already approved and had to make a decision about whether or not to endorse both those specific virus strains that had been vetted thoroughly and to endorse a universal influenza vaccine recommendation as has been the case for decades. 
> 
> And the decision was that this was not the time to fight on that hill about the universal influenza vaccine recommendation. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert Malone, ACIP [00:49:30]
> 
> There are some that suggests that the COVID products are causing various types of damage to the immune response that's leading to a susceptibility to one of the most common immunologically controlled diseases that we're all familiar with, which is cancer. 
> 
> And so the question came up and I asked it very gently whether the ACIP is tracking these issues, whether they have the data to support or refute these hypotheses. And the answer is no, they don't. 
> 
> So I hope that we as the ACIP going forward, frankly, my impression is that a lot of the thinking at the CDC in terms of these monitoring and analyses routines that they get into are a bit antiquated. 
> 
> They're kind of old school to use common slang. And, I think personally that the CDC will be well served, and so will the public, to start incorporating in their analyses newer frontline concepts about immune response.

## Statement from HHS spokesperson on Dr Vinay Prasad

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson
- **Date:** received July 3, 2025

> The idea that Dr. Prasad “overruled” FDA scientists is a distortion of the facts. He evaluated the totality of the evidence and made a judgment rooted in gold standard science. That’s not political—it’s what principled leadership looks like.
>  
> The reality is that the FDA has never permitted manufacturers to claim COVID-19 vaccines prevent Long Covid, because such a claim is not supported by high-quality evidence. While critics selectively cite fringe fears or speculate, the FDA will continue to follow the science and use evidence-based decision making. No honest scientist can claim that another booster for a healthy young adult meets that standard today.
>  
> Dr. Prasad is pursuing a course correction to bring U.S. policy in line with the rest of the developed world. That correction requires thoughtful review and clear documentation, not blind repetition of outdated frameworks. Dismissing this process as “cherry-picking” ignores the obvious: science evolves, and so must our policies.
>  
> Dr. Makary’s decision to elevate Dr. Prasad reflects the need for coherent, accountable leadership at the top of FDA. The consolidation of titles isn’t political—it’s a long-overdue response to years of fragmented decision-making that often lacked evidence-based judgment. Dr. Prasad’s leadership marks a return to scientific integrity—not a departure from it.
>  
> Let’s also be honest about who the loudest critics are. Many of the same so-called experts being quoted today are the ones who pushed policies that have since collapsed under scrutiny—advising cloth masks for toddlers or insisting that children receive dose after dose of a vaccine with no individualized benefit-risk evaluation. Their record speaks for itself. And if we’re talking about politics in vaccine policy, we should recall the rushed BLA approval under the Biden administration, which triggered mandates for millions—including those who already had COVID—and contributed to unnecessary adverse events like myocarditis. That disastrous move led to the resignation of FDA’s top two vaccine officials and remains one of the most damaging missteps in modern public health history.
>  
> Dr. Prasad is correcting course with data, with transparency, and with the courage to say what others won’t. That’s how trust in science is rebuilt.
