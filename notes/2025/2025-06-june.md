> The Defend the Spend initiative is a department-wide effort to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being used effectively, transparently, and in alignment with this administration. As part of this oversight, grant recipients may be asked to provide additional information, which is essential to preventing waste, fraud, and abuse.  HHS is committed to working all grantees to resolve outstanding issues as quickly as possible while maintaining the highest standards of accountability.

## HHS spokesperson on sharing data with Medicaid

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon
- **Date:** received June 13, 2025

> HHS and CMS take the integrity of the Medicaid program and the protection of American taxpayer dollars extremely seriously. With respect to the recent data sharing between CMS and DHS, HHS acted entirely within its legal authority – and in full compliance with all applicable laws – to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them.
> 
> This action is not unprecedented. What is unprecedented is the systemic neglect and policy failures under the Biden-Harris administration that opened the floodgates for illegal immigrants to exploit Medicaid – and forced hardworking Americans to foot the bill. In states like California, these failures are now on full display. While millions of Americans struggle to afford care, the state of California has aggressively expanded its taxpayer-funded health benefits to cover illegal immigrants – directly defying the intent of federal Medicaid law. California provides free, full-scope Medicaid coverage to low-income illegal immigrants, no questions asked. The Biden administration looked the other way and allowed federal funds to potentially flow into a system that is ripe for abuse.
> 
> The Biden administration not only failed to enforce the law—it actively created the conditions for abuse. Through rulemaking and policy guidance, it weakened state oversight, discouraged immigration verification, and tied the hands of CMS and state agencies alike. These deliberate choices have cost American taxpayers dearly and allowed benefits to be siphoned away from the vulnerable citizens they were designed to serve.
> 
> That ends now.
> 
> Under the leadership of Dr. Oz, CMS is aggressively cracking down on states that may be misusing federal Medicaid funds to subsidize care for illegal immigrants. This oversight effort – supported by lawful interagency data sharing with DHS – is focused on identifying waste, fraud, and systemic abuse. We are not only protecting taxpayer dollars – we are restoring credibility to one of America’s most vital programs. The American people deserve accountability. HHS is delivering it.

## HHS spokesperson on conflicts of interest in ACIP picks

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson
- **Date:** received June 12, 2025

> Secretary Kennedy is restoring public trust by reconstituting ACIP with highly credentialed doctors, scientists, and public health experts committed to evidence-based medicine, gold standard science, and common sense.
> 
> Unlike the old ACIP that had become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine, this group will go where the science takes them. They will demand definitive safety and efficacy data for any new vaccine recommendations. They will also review safety and efficacy data for the current vaccine schedule.
> 
> Before starting work on ACIP, the new members’ ethics agreements will be made public. Every ACIP member will be vetted in accordance with their ethics agreement before they are permitted to participate in each meeting agenda item.
> 
> The new ACIP members with experience serving on similar HHS expert panels include:
> 
> Martin Kulldorff, MD, PhD, served on the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Subgroup of ACIP and on the FDA’s Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee.
> <br>Cody Meissner, MD, served on both ACIP and the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.
> <br>Vicky Pebsworth, OP, PhD, RN, served on the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.
> <br>Michael A. Ross, MD, served on the CDC’s Advisory Committee for the Prevention of Breast and Cervical Cancer.
> 
> Secretary Kennedy has replaced vaccine groupthink with a diversity of viewpoints on ACIP.

> I think, you know, and you had posted the criticism of my choice by Senator Cassidy and a claim that I had promised Senator Cassidy not to change the vaccine panels. That's not true. 
> 
> What I told Senator Cassidy is that I would allow him to put one of his candidates on which we are going to do.

## ACIP FAQ shared with stakeholders

- **Source:** document
- **Attribution:** obtained by CBS News
- **Date:** received June 11, 2025

> ACIP FAQ
> 
> What Authority Does the Secretary Have to Reform ACIP?
> 
> 42 USC § 217a give the Secretary the authority to establish discretionary advisory committees, such as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). As a Federal Advisory Committee covered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act and its implementing regulations, “advisory committee members serve at the pleasure of the appointing or inviting authority. Membership terms are at the sole discretion of the appointing or inviting authority.” 41 C.F.R. § 120-3.130(a).
> 
> Why Did the Secretary Do This?
> 
> The American people elected President Trump to support a review of vaccine policy to improve public trust in vaccines. The Biden administration attempted to block a full scientific review of vaccines by appointing members on the ACIP at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) before President Trump assumed office. The previous administration tried to prevent membership changes until 2028. This action will restore regular order to the important vaccine committee. Secretary Kennedy is restoring transparency and gold standard science to ACIP.
> 
> How was the current ACIP Roster Appointed?
> 
> All the current ACIP members are Biden appointees. 13 were appointed and one term was extended in 2024, and three appointments were made in 2021. Several were appointed after the election in the “Midnight Hour” of the Biden administration.
> 
> Does This Affect Private Insurance Coverage, Medicaid, or the Vaccines for Children Program?
> 
> This decision does not affect insurance coverage or any program that relies on ACIP recommendations.
> 
> Does This Affect the Vaccine Schedules?
> 
> This decision does not affect the childhood vaccine schedule.
> 
> How Are New Members Being Selected?
> 
> New members will be selected through a rigorous examination of their scientific credentials and a comprehensive ethics review for potential conflicts of interest.
> 
> Will the June ACIP Meeting Still Go Forward?
> 
> The June ACIP meeting that was announced on Friday, June 6th will go forward as scheduled.
> 
> Is There Precedent for HHS Secretaries to Use their Authority to Make Changes to the Composition of this Panel?
> 
> What President Biden did to ACIP was truly unprecedented, including stacking the ACIP in the final year of a presidential term through “Midnight Hour” appointments. Increasing ACIP membership beyond the historical 15 or 16 members, was also unprecedented. 
> 
> Secretary Kennedy is restoring the Committee to precedent and reconstituting ACIP into an objective scientific body, rather than a political forum
> 
> Does this Personnel Change Affect ACIP Procedures?
> 
> No.
> 
> Are the Terms of New Members Staggered or will there Need to be a Completely New Board After New Members Serve Their 4-Year Term?
> 
> The new members will be appointed with staggered two- to four-year terms to ensure that ACIP returns to regular order and retains institutional knowledge.
> 
> How Will HHS Ensure Balance of Views Being Represented When Filling All New Member Seats?
> 
> We will be appointing scientists, public health experts, and doctors to ensure balanced membership in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed so that all vaccine recommendations are made without bias.
> 
> What Is the Role of the Secretary in the Member Nomination Selection Process in the Absence of a CDC Director?
> 
> The Secretary is vested with the authority to make these appointments in accordance with statutory authority under 42 USC 217a and regulatory authority found in 41 C.F.R. § 120-3.130(a).
> 
> Does this Announcement Affect the 31 Non-Voting Liaison Representatives from the American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, et al?
> 
> Liaison membership is not affected.

## HHS secretary at USDA event, talks about ACIP

- **Date:** occurred June 10, 2025

> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [05:26:58]
> 
> In terms of changes to ACIP, this had been a long time coming. 
> 
> More than two decades ago, Congress investigated ACIP, the government oversight committee found that, for example, that year, which was 2003, gave one example that 4 out of the 5 people who added the rotavirus vaccine to the schedule had direct financial interest in that vaccine. One of those individuals voted the rotavirus onto the vaccine and sold his rotavirus vaccine that he had in development for $186 million. He said he won the lottery.
> 
> That year, Congress says that 97% of the people on ACIP had undisclosed conflicts. So people have known about this for years. 
> 
> You know, probably the worst example of malevolent malpractice has been adding all of these new products to this schedule without doing pre-licensing safety studies. In 1986, there were 11 vaccines on the schedule. Today, a compliant child must take between 69 and 92 vaccines to stay in school in some states. And not one of them has been safety tested in a pre licensing placebo controlled trial. And that is just malpractice. 
> 
> So the people who are in charge of that are now gone, and we're going to bring people onto the ACIP panel, not anti-vaxxers, who are bringing people on who are credentialed scientists, who are highly credentialed physicians, who are going to do evidence based medicine, who are going to be objective and who are going to follow the science and make critical public health determinations for our children based upon the best science.

## NIH director at Senate Appropriations hearing

> BALDWIN 10:31:00
>
> Dr. Bhattacharya, I'm struggling to find a reason why NIH would implement this forward funding policy. How is this proposal anything but intentionally sabotaging biomedical research? 
>
> BHATTACHARYA 
>
> So, Senator, a couple of things. So, one is, regarding funding for this year, Congress allocated the money. My job is to make sure that the money goes to excellent research projects. My intention is that we will spend--
>
> BALDWIN
>
> I'm asking about the forward funding proposal that disguises even deeper cuts in the NIH budget than the budget submission would suggest.
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> Yeah, so I just wanted to preface my answer to that, because you asked that also. But, as regarding forward funding, that's a budget proposal. I mean, again, the--
>
> BALDWIN
>
> Well, you don't deny that it reduces the amount that will be spent on biomedical research next year by an even deeper amount than the 18 billion dollars, 40% cut already. 
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> Right, so the way the forward funding works, right now we have multi-year projects that we fund. And forward funding says we will allocate the money for those multi-year projects this year, rather than in the out years. In principle--
>
> BALDWIN
>
> And so, if it's a four-year project, three of the years will sit in an escrow account and not be spent next year. Again, further diminishing the amount that will be spent on biomedical research. 
>
> BHATTACHARYA 
>
> I think, I mean--  I think the thing is, in the long run, what it does is allow you to spend more money and have more flexibility for new research projects. That's because what it says-- 
>
> BALDWIN  
>
> That's funny math.   
>
> BHATTACHARYA  
>
> I mean, it's just the math. I mean, I'm an economist, also. What it does is it says, look, let's allocate the money this year so that next year, the money isn't tied up for-- on previous years' projects. That's, in the long run.  
>
> I think, as I said, I'm happy to work with Congress and looking forward to working with Congress on this. This is a budget proposal, not a final thing.  
>
> I think if I had to start and redesign the system again from the start, allowing more flexibility as new scientific opportunities come up with the forward funding model makes-- allows that to happen, actually, more than the current model where large fractions of the NIH budget are tied up with old projects.   
>
> So I think that-- but as the transition in, it really matters how we do it, and so I'm absolutely really glad to work with Congress on that, to make sure that there's no disruptions.  
>
> …
>
> 10:41:49 DURBIN
>
> When you look at specific schools, of course, I’m concerned about Illinois. We have great research there. 
>
> Northwestern University has not received a penny for NIH grants in 11 weeks. 1,359 NIH awards to Northwestern have been frozen or terminated, halting $81 million in research to date. 
>
> I could go through some of the specifics of this research. But it includes $9 million in clinical trials for brain cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, childhood cancer. How are you able to reconcile these budget decisions, with the reality of research and what it means to alleviate suffering, and more importantly, they give people hope, if research is underway, you at least have the hope that maybe there'll be a cure, maybe in the lifetime of someone I love. 
>
> How can you walk away from that?
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> It was my intention not to walk away from that. I mean, I think that-- 
>
> DURBIN
>
> But the budget speaks for itself. You cut $18 billion in research.
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> Senator, the budget is a collaboration between Congress and the administration. So, you know, I look forward to talking about the advances that NIH researchers have made.
>
> I mean, I think the transition has been a very bumpy time, and I don't mean to, like, downplay that, but there have been opportunities for reform for how the biomedical research enterprise works. 
>
> I think the decisions about Northwestern happened before I got into office, but-- let me just say that--
>
> DURBIN
>
> The buck stops in your office. 
>
> BHATTACHARYA 
>
> I know it does, so let me just say that--
>
> DURBIN
>
> Don't blame another person. 
>
> BHATTACHARYA 
>
> I'm not blaming anybody. 
>
> DURBIN
>
> We're asking you, and you're in charge. 
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> Senator, I agree with that. So let me just say that I think that the way that the universities operated during the pandemic wasn't always-- didn't always make it easy for scientists to--to do their work. I can tell you that personally, from being a professor. And I think, some of the—
>
> …
>
> DURBIN
>
> But eliminating grants, eliminating research, how can that solve the problem? 
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> So, I think that I'm very hopeful that a resolution can be made with the universities where those decisions have been-- those grants have been paused. 
>
> I've worked very hard to make sure, for instance, at Harvard, we didn't pause grants, for instance, to the medical centers, because there were clinical trials going on. 
>
> But I think that this is-- I'm very hopeful that these universities where these pauses have happened will come to terms so that we can move forward with the agenda that I think you and I both share.
>
> …
>
> BHATTACHARYA 11:15:38
>
> Senator, can I just address the HIV? Because I am absolutely committed to the-- in 2019, President Trump issued a challenge for us to eliminate the threat of HIV in this country. And we've had a 22% reduction in HIV transmission since then.
>
> We now have the technological tools to do that. And I've been working on developing a program to actually implement this vision, so we can use—
>
> MURRAY
>
> But you did terminate the HIV research at Fred Hutch that, again, was on the cusp of a treatment for 6,000 patients nationwide. You did do that. 
>
> BHATTACHARYA 
>
> I'd have to get back to you on that. 
>
> MURRAY
>
> You did do that. 
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> Senator, I mean, I think we actually have now the chance, with existing technologies, lenacapavir and other technologies, to actually address—
>
> MURRAY
>
> I'm delighted to hear that, but I'm just telling you what clinical trials have been terminated. And I’m asking you this because we have to write an appropriations bill.
>
> …
>
> SHAHEEN 11:26:32
>
> We had this conversation, as you pointed out, and that's why it was so puzzling to me to see what the budget proposes in terms of slashing the funding for NIDDK.
>
> So help me understand why that is and how that's going to improve our research into diabetes? 
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> Senator, I think the budget is a negotiation, a collaboration between the administration and Congress, and you'll have your say.
>
> I think for my job is to make sure that the funds that you all appropriate to me make—are-- go to advancing and meeting the health needs of the American people.
>
> I think that that's-- that's a productive thing. I'm hearing from basically everybody that the NIH is a valued – is really valued in Congress, and I find that gratifying. 
>
> I value the NIH, and so you know, I don't-- the administration, President Trump has committed the that the U.S. be the leading nation in biomedicine in the 21st century, and I entirely support that goal.
>
> SHAHEEN
>
> Well, I do too, but it's hard to understand how we're going to get there when the budget slashes funding, particularly in critical areas of research.
>
> …
>
> BHATTACHARYA 11:32:56
>
> Senator, I've established a process for appeals for those grant terminations and decisions. And hundreds of people have appealed. 
>
> It won't take 18 months. It'll take weeks to get through those appeals. We've reversed many of them. 
>
> I mean, I didn't take this job to terminate grants. I took this job to make sure that we do the research that advances the health needs of the American people 
>
> SCHATZ
>
> Okay, so give me, like, a time frame for processing all of them. 
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> I mean, it's hard to promise a specific timeframe, but it won't take-- it won't be years, it'll be weeks.
>
> I mean, I spent the last couple of weeks-- last few weeks, I think it was, like, a month ago, we set up the appeals process.
>
> And they've been working through those numbers, those grant applications. 
>
> SCHATZ
>
> Can we agree that we shouldn't do it that way again?
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> I mean, I—
>
> SCHATZ
>
> I know you have to survive in this administration, but can we agree that this is not the most helpful way to do things? 
>
> BHATTACHARYA

> I mean, I think a lot of those decisions were made before I got in.

> Do you believe that some vaccines save lives?
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 03:34:53
> 
> Yes. Many vaccines save lives.
> 
> QUESTION 03:34:56
> 
> Do you believe that some vaccines that are given to children save lives?
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 03:35:01
> 
> Yes.
> 
> QUESTION 03:35:02
> 
> Do you believe that some vaccines are known to be harmful and yet still given?
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 03:35:07
> 
> Let me, let me say a specific one. 
> 
> I think the COVID vaccine for children, in particular, I don't think is net beneficial for kids
> 
> QUESTION 03:35:14
> 
> Not-- but you said not net beneficial? Does that mean it's harmful?
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 03:35:19
> 
> Net harmful.
> 
> QUESTION 03:35:20
> 
> You believe that the COVID vaccine is net harmful--
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 03:35:23
> 
> For-- especially for young men.
> 
> QUESTION 03:35:25
> 
> Can you define the age cutoff there?
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 03:35:27
> 
> We can argue about this. Like there's a scientific-- but I think it's pretty clear that, I don't know, somewhere between age 12 and 30 or something for boys and men, young men, the COVID vaccine is probably net harmful.
> 
> Again, with full boys who have no other underlying conditions and all that, there’s--
> 
> QUESTION 03:35:46
> 
> Not obese, no heart condition--
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 03:35:48
> 
> Well, I mean, even obese, you have to like, look at the numbers. 
> 
> I mean, I there's lots of debates and fights over this in scientific literature. So I hesitate to like actually give you a specific age threshold, but I think just as a general matter, there exist groups for whom the COVID vaccine was net harmful, specifically young men.
> 
> QUESTION 03:36:05
> 
> Do you think there's any reason to think that the adjuvants that essentially what the vaccines are suspended in, not the vaccines themselves, are potentially harmful? I've heard this. I don't-- I am personally not aware of any strong evidence for it.
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 03:36:21
> 
> I think these are one, these are the kind of things that ought to be investigated, but it's very difficult to investigate just because of the sort of like political aura around vaccines, where if you ask, if you are-- if you really do investigate it and find something, that's the public health authorities don't like, you're going to have trouble. 
> 
> I think there-- I don't know the answer to that question, from a scientific point of view.
> 
> …
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 04:08:57
> 
> I think that there's good evidence on the MMR vaccine that, of failing to find a link with autism.
> 
> There’s, and I don't know the full extent of this literature, so I shouldn't comment too much, but I've -- when I've looked I haven't seen quite the same level of evidence for some of the other vaccines failing-- just haven't that again, they just haven't looked.
> 
> As a general matter, I think it's an unlikely, just from a biological point of view, unlikely to be the main reason why autism-- the rise in autism, which is now well documented that you talked about, has occurred. 
> 
> So to me, the question then is thinking about autism, you're asking, and you want to tell parents, answer for parents, well, what does cause what does, has led to the rise in the prevalence of autism? 
> 
> The  honest answer is, I don't know, you focused on what're focused now in this conversation on just one potential cause, vaccines. To me, it's unlikely that they are the reason for the rise in the cause of autism. But there are many other potential hypotheses for the rise in the prevalence of autism that I've seen, so alterations, the gut microbiome I've seen.
> 
> …
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 04:11:44
> 
> Unless you understand the etiology, it might be different etiology for kids in different parts of the spectrum, then you're never gonna have good answers, both for prevention and also for therapies. 
> 
> So it's that question that Bobby Kennedy's asked me to answer or try to get an answer. And that President Trump has asked to get an answer and I think it's appropriate because if you ask me what is, I mean, we just talked about vaccines as a potential cause I think it's unlikely to be the cause, but you can see my mind is open, for depending on the levels of evidence I've seen.
> 
> Now, this is not my area, right. Just, I should say this, like I'm saying this as someone who's now like tried to wade into it some just to get a sense of it. But, as I've waited into it, it's very, very clear that there is not a scientific question, a consensus answering the question of what causes the rise in autism or what is the etiology of autism.
> 
> …
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 04:15:33
> 
> So what I've done is I've organized an initiative inside the NIH to address this question of the etiology of autism.
> 
> QUESTION: 
> 
> Not limited to vaccines?
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 
> 
> No, wide ranging, it includes basic science work. It includes epidemiological work, it'll include environmental exposure work, includes all -- and we'll bring together data sets that will make available to the researchers. We will have a competition among scientists, just like the normal NIH way with peer review panels, to ask who should get the awards.
> 
> We'll have a dozen or more scientific teams asking the question, what is the etiology of autism. We’ll have that, I think that normally it takes a year or longer to set up a thing like this. We’ll, by September, we'll have like an open competition for these scientific projects. 
> 
> And, you can’t rush science, but hoping within a relatively short period of time, who knows how long exactly depends on how science works. We'll have a much better understanding of the etiology of autism than we have at this current moment.
> 
> …
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 04:16:49
> 
> On vaccines, can I say one thing?
> 
> Now, I don't want to—as the NIH director, I don't want to put my thumb on the scale on any part of these potential etiologies, right. As I already said, I'm not particularly an expert in this area. 
> 
> And so even if I were to put my thumb on the scale, would be from, not from the point of view of expertise, it would just be the point of view of, like, I just happened to read the literature and I was impressed by X, Y, or Z. 
> 
> But if I were to put my thumb on the scale, I think it would make it more difficult, A for scientists to ask the question, honestly, because they want to impress the NIH director or something and then B for the public to trust the result at the end.

## FDA infant formula expert panel

> Steven Abrams, Panelist [10:12:53]
> 
> There are some basic things like iron, calcium and phosphorus that have a tremendous need to be updating and harmonize as best possible with European and Codex, which are World Health Organization standards. 
> 
> Our standards for these nutrients in many cases are quite different. And just to give you an example, the iron in infant formula in the United States is much higher than it is allowed to even be in Europe. And the current science supports the European perspective. 
> 
> So it's a chance for us to take a look at every nutrient, not just the seed oils and say, do we need to set our limits? Where do we need to look at what needs to be done? And can we harmonize so that the world sees formula in one way and families, as they're trying to say, well, I want to buy a formula that's made in Europe can understand that the formulas made in the United States meet those same standards for them. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Marty Makary, FDA [10:03:16]
> 
> We really want to learn from you. We desperately need to innovate in this space and that means regulatory innovation. 
> 
> So we want to hear your ideas unprompted, unfiltered, tell us exactly what you think needs to be done to improve the health of babies and children in the United States and worldwide through the regulatory authorities that we have. 
> 
> And I mean that sincerely as moms want to see more options for formula, they want to see formula options without seed oils. They want to see formula options without corn syrup. They want to see formula options without added sugar, and some of those are already on the market. 
> 
> And in other spaces, we, as a regulatory body can help facilitate some of that innovation. 
> 
> There's been almost no change to the monograph for baby formula since 1998, with the exception of adding selenium. 
> 
> Now, in my view, the field of medical science does not stay stagnant for 26 years in any space. And it's hard to believe that is the only sort of enlightened moment that we've had in understanding how best to nourish children. 
> 
> There are people who are concerned about the heavy metal levels in formula. And I think for foremost to this entire conversation, we have to acknowledge that we all want the same thing. 
> 
> There are no malicious actors and we have to see the best in everybody, and this should not be a us versus them with any stakeholder group or any innovator developer or company out there. 
> 
> This is an expert forum to ask how can we think collectively about what's best for some of the most vulnerable in our nation.
> 
> Gandhi once said that the true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members, our seniors and our children. 
> 
> And so, we look forward to your ideas. We are going to take them very seriously. 
> 
> This is not a horse and pony show where you get to say what you think. And then we ignore it and say that we had a forum. This is a true listening session. 
> 
> And so we are going to take your ideas and go back to our subject matter experts and the terrific career scientists at the FDA who have been working on this and our policy staff and ask, what can we do differently? 
> 
> ...
> 
> Tom Brenna, Panelist [10:20:29]
> 
> So now I get onto the topic of seed oils. Well, seed oils are one sort of oil. There's two other kinds of oils, fruit oils and let's say cows milk fat, and you can maybe think of other ones, but those are the major ones. 
> 
> And the thing I want to -- the one point that I want to make scientifically here is that it's not just about some problem with seed oils. They're-- it's not all seed oils are the same. 
> 
> So in this study, rhesus monkeys, pregnant rhesus monkeys were fed formulas that had all of their fat that came from either soybean oil or from safflower oil, both seed oils on the hit parade these days. 
> 
> And, so when the infants were born, they were weaned to those essentially formulas where that was the only source of fat and what they measured was visual acuity.
> 
> Now visual acuity in humans or primates or pretty much any other mammal is a measure of brain development, not just retinal development. And what you find is that with safflower oil, which is very omega-3 deficient, much less, much slower development of visual acuity, and that's the lower line there, and I don't really have a pointer, but if you get to the end there's a red circle, and that corresponds on the eye chart to about a 2100, on our familiar scale where 2020 is normal vision. But in soybean oil, which has some omega 3, it's got the plant one, but it has some omega 3. They have a vision at 12 weeks of age of 2050, so much, much better. 
> 
> And, as it turns out, if you give these same animals a source of omega 3's, EPA and DHA, so fish oil, classic fish oil, when they get a little bit older, let's say starting at about a year, the ones that on the lower curve don't recover. So you've gotta get this right early on. That's another salient point we have to make. 
> 
> So it's not just about seed oils, it's about what we replaced them with. Something like 60 or 70% of the edible oils in the United States are seed oils. And so if we shut it off tomorrow, domestic seed oil, I should say. So, there are things we can do to make it better. There's no question about that. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Michael Goran, Panelist [11:05:06]
> 
> The FDA regulates these older regulations that we're talking about, they only regulate the amount of carbohydrate, not the type of carbohydrate. So during the last 20 or 30 years, there's been all kinds of different types of carbohydrates introduced into infant formula. And in fact, now today, the majority of infant formula sold in the U.S. is made with non lactose sugars, such as sucrose, which is ordinary table sugar. But most of the non lactose formulas are in fact made with corn syrup solids, which is a glucose polymer, meaning it's a big molecule of glucose, sugars joint together, in one big polymer. So there's no, there's no galactose there. So it's a very different type of sugar, it is handled quite differently in the body.
> 
> And, this I think has occurred through a series of concerning situations, mostly due to misunderstanding by the public, as well as advertising and marketing claims, based on the concept of lactose intolerance in babies. So these are often sold as gentle formulas or marketed towards fussy babies, but actually this-- the fact is that almost all full term babies can digest lactose, which is the only carbohydrate energy source in breast milk. 
> 
> Now, in addition, um, emerging research just quite recently, probably in the last five or 10 years is beginning to show that these non lactose carbohydrates in formula are linked to a number of different outcomes, including alteration of the infant microbiome, which is the colonization of gut of microbes in the gut changes and taste and food preference because these glucose polymers from corn syrup are much sweeter than lactose and also a study that we published a couple of years ago in collaboration with WIC, so it was a very large population, showing an increased risk of obesity in children who were fed formula made with corn syrup versus traditional formula made with lactoses.
> 
> ...
> 
> Michael Goran, Panelist [11:10:02]
> 
> I think there should be consideration just like the EU is doing to determine an allowable level of glucose polymers that that would be okay to deal with, to deal with as a, and or a required level of lactose should be determined. 
> 
> It's very hard for consumers to know, other than looking at the ingredient list on the back of the product, whether either lactose or milk sugar would be listed as an ingredient or something like corn syrup, it would be listed as the ingredient. There's no other labeling law. 
> 
> I think there should be consideration if there is lactose intolerance. I don't know why there was a decision made to go straight to corn syrup to resolve that issue. That's not what adults with lactose intolerance would do. So there should-- could be a consideration to break apart the lactose into the residual sugars of glucose and galactose, as probably a healthier issue than using corn syrup. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Steven Abrams, Panelist [11:16:17]
> 
> There are a lot of issues involved in this regulation. So for example, labeling approaches and legalities are different in Europe than they are in the United States about average versus minimum content. So I think that we can't just take European or EFSA guidelines and just turn them into the U.S., and that's why the FDA is here, but I think the FDA does need to reach out the content experts people in-- I mean, we have people about fat. We have people involved in carbohydrates. We have people involved in minerals, people involved in oligosaccharides. And I think each of those are kind of their own scientific groups and interacting with established groups, which include groups like American Society for Nutrition, American Academy of Pediatrics is helpful. But I think ultimately there are topic experts that are going to be need to be reached out to it. We can't-- I think there's a lot to be gained from trying to harmonize as much as possible with European guidelines. I think that would be tremendously valuable for everyone, but there are differences in how we regulate formulas and how we label them and that need to be addressed in doing that. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Tim Sentongo, Panelist [11:27:21]
> 
> We do have pretty compelling data that shows that excess protein is a big contributor to rapid weight gain because the infant formulas have the same caloric density. The different components are matched differently. Some fats are blended, some carbohydrates have corn starch syrup, others are lactose. But the big differences at that time between breast milk and infant formula is breast milk has about 1.4 grams of protein per a hundred calories. Whereas standard infant formulas have more than that. And the guidelines give a ranges higher as 4.5 grams of protein per a hundred calories. 
> 
> So you can just see that that excess protein intake, clearly programs -- has something to do with the programming of how children grow in the first couple of years of life. And if you follow these children, you realize that if you're over-- if you're very big in the first three years of your life, you'll likely be bigger overweight during your preschool years during your school age years. And if you enter adolescence as being overweight, that probability of turning that around is gets less and less and less again with all the additional environmental things that in our diets and that we choose to make, that programming continues. 
> 
> So clearly the protein data I think is compelling enough. I think the Europeans, I think have had, I think they have more tighter. They have a narrow range of proteins that they recommend. And that's also one of the reasons I believe why cows milk, which has a much high protein content is really discouraged in infants. 
> 
> Of course at another age is encouraged, but even in a controlled amount, because you take too much of it, ultra protein, those kids really get very overweight. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Steven Abrams, Panelist [11:35:50]
> 
> So the FDA over decades has created an immense and overwhelming process to make sure that that formula is safe and it's been extremely effective, but the formula shortage has pointed out that there are times when we needed to bring in formulas that did not go through the full FDA process. Many of which had safely been used overseas for many, many years with excellent testing done using overseas guidance. 
> 
> So I think there is the opportunity for us to take a look and that's what the NASEM panel did and say, how do we make sure that we maintain that absolute level of excellence of FDA review of formula, but also add certain types of flexibility. Do we really need six visits? Do we really need for the growth studies? Do we really need to not enroll anyone who is not only on formula by two weeks of age, all sorts of very strict kind of rules that may be flexible as we bring upon new sources of protein, different types of energy and those sorts of things. 
> 
> And that's what the FDA I think can really take a look at with the scientific world and take a look at what the European experience has been. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Andrea Gilbaugh, Panelist [11:42:16]
> 
> So formula companies marketing is part of the confusion. It confuses healthcare professionals, it confuses families. So if there are limitations on the marketing that they were allowed to do, I think education would be easier for healthcare professionals. 
> 
> They say some really dramatic things like designed to reduce crying in 24 hours. So if that's on a can of formula and you're thinking, okay, well I'm breastfeeding, but if this is designed to reduce crying in 24 hours, maybe I should try this because my baby keeps crying. 
> 
> Another thing that they've said is just what your baby needs and nothing they don't. So I think there's a lot of misleading in the labeling and we need to look at that.
> 
> ...
> 
> Tom Brenna, Panelist [11:48:44]
> 
> I think we can get on with the business of updating our regulations for fatty acids, and get with the rest of the world. And maybe, if we do it right, we might be able to get ahead of the rest of the world, while we're at it, that's the first thing. And those would be the underlying fatty acids. 
> 
> And the second thing is, if we have a chance to have a detailed discussion, and as the commissioner said, not just walking out of here and saying, gee, we did something, but actually getting together and discussing it, we can do something about the seed oil story, which doesn't mean, I don't think getting rid of all seed oils, but giving moms and dads options, which I think is what the point was.

## CDC spokesperson on GII.17 seasonality

> There are currently insufficient historic data to predict whether norovirus GII.17 will remain the dominant genotype and lead to an earlier onset of the norovirus season later this year. In the United States, GII.17 has only circulated at low levels and has never been the dominant norovirus strain. Following the surge of GII.17 strains in Asia and parts of Europe in 2014, the GII.4 Sydney variant re-emerged as the dominant genotype by 2016 with no reports of seasonality change. At this time, there is no clear evidence linking the GII.17 genotype to changes in norovirus seasonality. We will continue to monitor norovirus outbreaks through CaliciNet and will report any early activity or emerging trends through our website https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/php/reporting/calicinet-data.html.

> 08 27 26 MAKARY: Moms want more options for baby formula.
> 
> They want baby formula options with no corn syrup, no seed oils. They want baby formula options with no added sugar. 
> 
> And we've seen no innovation in the baby formula space since 1998, with the exception of simply adding selenium. 
> 
> The research has moved and we have now had great learnings in the medical field, but the regulatory obstacles have not allowed companies to really innovate. So we're going to look at all of it.
> 
> We're going to look at heavy metals in baby formulas, on the-- in the supply chain, you know there was a shortage in the last administration, so we're going to get ahead of it and deliver for moms what they want, which is more options for baby formula.
> 
> QUESTION: Yeah, when my daughter was an infant, I relied on this, and I just trusted-- she had some tummy issues, and so I had to get this one particular formula. But I didn't know what was in it, I just listened to the doctors.
> 
> Do we have seed oils, do we have heavy metals in our formulas?
> 
> MAKARY: Yes, seed oil-- it is almost impossible to find baby formula without seed oils and seed oils are not a naturally occurring substance. 
> 
> You know, in the history of mankind, they did not press seeds and extract the oils and then add a chemical solvent to it, and then bleach it, just to increase the shelf life. 
> 
> And generally it is-- they're believed to be pro-inflammatory. We don't want babies with general body inflammation. 40% of our nation's kids have a chronic condition. Many of those are tied to inflammation and insulin resistance.
> 
> Moms want more options and we're going to deliver.

> Sarah Gebauer, FDA [00:38:07]
> 
> Now that we've issued the final rule to update the criteria for the claim, we are continuing our efforts on developing a healthy symbol, and this would be a visual way that manufacturers could demonstrate that their product meets the healthy criteria. 
> 
> And we've conducted consumer research on a potential healthy symbol to help us understand what would really be helpful to consumers. And you can see some symbols that were tested in the middle of the slide. And symbols can be particularly helpful, for example, for people who are less familiar with nutrition information, by having that visual to let consumers know that a product qualifies for the claim. 
> 
> Finally, we will be working with manufacturers to support implementation of the claim. We see opportunities for using the healthy claim beyond the label and using creative ways to leverage the healthy claim. And we are eager to work with interested groups to support the use of the healthy claim, so that it's really as impactful and helpful as possible to consumers. 
>

> 
> Sarah Gebauer, FDA [00:48:27]

> So as mentioned in the presentation, we have been working on developing a healthy symbol. The symbol would be a standardized graphic, and I showed some examples on the slide that manufacturers could use to show that their products meet the healthy criteria. And so it can really be sort of as that quick visual.
> 
> We have conducted two rounds of focus groups and also an experimental study of-- related to a healthy symbol, to really learn what would be the most useful for consumers. And we don't have a specific timeline to share at this point, but again, we are continuing to work on the healthy symbol work.
> 
> Robin McKinnon, FDA [00:49:10]
> 
> Maybe I can just add on there, Sarah, as well. We know that, because I was involved in some of the early work on the healthy symbol, and we found that people-- they were hesitant to engage, especially manufacturers, on the symbol until they had seen the updated criteria. 
> 
> So now it's kind of a natural progression, if you like, to have finalized the updated criteria and then to be turning a focus to the-- towards the symbol.
