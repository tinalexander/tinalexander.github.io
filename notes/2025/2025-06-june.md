> 08 27 26 MAKARY: Moms want more options for baby formula.
> 
> They want baby formula options with no corn syrup, no seed oils. They want baby formula options with no added sugar. 
> 
> And we've seen no innovation in the baby formula space since 1998, with the exception of simply adding selenium. 
> 
> The research has moved and we have now had great learnings in the medical field, but the regulatory obstacles have not allowed companies to really innovate. So we're going to look at all of it.
> 
> We're going to look at heavy metals in baby formulas, on the-- in the supply chain, you know there was a shortage in the last administration, so we're going to get ahead of it and deliver for moms what they want, which is more options for baby formula.
> 
> QUESTION: Yeah, when my daughter was an infant, I relied on this, and I just trusted-- she had some tummy issues, and so I had to get this one particular formula. But I didn't know what was in it, I just listened to the doctors.
> 
> Do we have seed oils, do we have heavy metals in our formulas?
> 
> MAKARY: Yes, seed oil-- it is almost impossible to find baby formula without seed oils and seed oils are not a naturally occurring substance. 
> 
> You know, in the history of mankind, they did not press seeds and extract the oils and then add a chemical solvent to it, and then bleach it, just to increase the shelf life. 
> 
> And generally it is-- they're believed to be pro-inflammatory. We don't want babies with general body inflammation. 40% of our nation's kids have a chronic chronic condition. Many of those are tied to inflammation and insulin resistance.
> 
> Moms want more options and we're going to deliver.

> Sarah Gebauer, FDA [00:38:07]
> 
> Now that we've issued the final rule to update the criteria for the claim, we are continuing our efforts on developing a healthy symbol, and this would be a visual way that manufacturers could demonstrate that their product meets the healthy criteria. 
> 
> And we've conducted consumer research on a potential healthy symbol to help us understand what would really be helpful to consumers. And you can see some symbols that were tested in the middle of the slide. And symbols can be particularly helpful, for example, for people who are less familiar with nutrition information, by having that visual to let consumers know that a product qualifies for the claim. 
> 
> Finally, we will be working with manufacturers to support implementation of the claim. We see opportunities for using the healthy claim beyond the label and using creative ways to leverage the healthy claim. And we are eager to work with interested groups to support the use of the healthy claim, so that it's really as impactful and helpful as possible to consumers. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Sarah Gebauer, FDA [00:48:27]
> 
> So as mentioned in the presentation, we have been working on developing a healthy symbol. The symbol would be a standardized graphic, and I showed some examples on the slide that manufacturers could use to show that their products meet the healthy criteria. And so it can really be sort of as that quick visual.
> 
> We have conducted two rounds of focus groups and also an experimental study of-- related to a healthy symbol, to really learn what would be the most useful for consumers. And we don't have a specific timeline to share at this point, but again, we are continuing to work on the healthy symbol work.
> 
> Robin McKinnon, FDA [00:49:10]
> 
> Maybe I can just add on there, Sarah, as well. We know that, because I was involved in some of the early work on the healthy symbol, and we found that people-- they were hesitant to engage, especially manufacturers, on the symbol until they had seen the updated criteria. 
> 
> So now it's kind of a natural progression, if you like, to have finalized the updated criteria and then to be turning a focus to the-- towards the symbol.
