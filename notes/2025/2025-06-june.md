> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [00:53:42]
> 
> And on the ACIP meeting, the-- I would watch that because I think that's going to be really-- I don't think we, we know what that's going to be like.
> 
> I'm optimistic because I provide through my center, all of the data and science that should inform discussion. And so I'm hoping that that information will be the kind of thing that will trigger like really good generative discussions. 
> 
> But I do think it's one to watch. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Demetre Daskalakis, CDC [01:00:44]
> 
> For COVID I think that's where it's gonna get a little interesting because of the framework that's that the FDA is putting out from the regulatory perspective. So the way that their framework is written is if you're over 65, slam dunk, get the COVID vaccine. If you're between, I think there, it was like, if you're six months to 64, you should get the COVID vaccine based on their framework. If you have underlying conditions and their list of underlying conditions is pretty extensive where about 90% of the American population have them. 
> 
> And so I think where it's getting interesting is the recommendation for me, I'm 51, I'm healthy. I don't have the underlying risk factors, although I guess I sit on my couch and watch TV. So maybe I'm sedentary sometimes, maybe, but that is sort of the space where they're looking to say, does there need to be more randomized control studies to figure out the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine? 
> 
> So from the CDC perspective, the data that we have in the real world, our vaccine effectiveness data, really demonstrates that there is a role for the vaccine regardless of underlying medical condition. And so that's going to be a really interesting conversation at the ACIP, because our vaccine effectiveness data really show that. 
> 
> And there is, I think, some debate as to what they would define as sort of gold standard science in sort of achieving the goal of really understanding the effectiveness of COVID vaccine. It's going to be a really interesting area for a few years, I think.

- **Date:** received June 18, 2025

> Here are the answers to your questions. They are attributable to a CDC Spokesperson:
> 
> Q1. Am I interpreting the figures correctly that there have been now 36 cases in people with two MMR doses?
> 
>  Yes. Nationally, 36 cases occurred in people that had two documented doses of MMR vaccine.
> 
> Q2. How many of those received vaccine as post-exposure prophylaxis?
> 
> None of these individuals received MMR vaccine as post-exposure prophylaxis. The vaccination data on our website reflect a patient’s vaccination status at the time of their exposure to measles.
> 
> Q3. How many of the 36 cases have been in older adults or in young children?
> 
> Of the 36 cases, none were younger than 5 years old; 5 (14%) were ages 5-19 years; 30 (83%) were ages 20 years and older; and 1 (3%) had an unknown age.
> 
> Q4. Have any of the cases been hospitalized?
> 
> None of the measles cases hospitalized this year had documented evidence of receiving two doses of MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles and its complications. Disease symptoms are generally milder in vaccinated people. People who are vaccinated are also less likely to spread the disease to other people. The decision to vaccinate is a personal one. People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.

> Kyle Diamantas, FDA [00:13:00]
> 
> We also are excited to embark on an effort co-led with USDA, and on behalf of other government partners, to establish a consistent definition for ultra processed foods. 
> 
> We expect to post a request for information on this issue by the end of this month.
> 
> ...
> 
> Elizabeth Miller, FDA [00:24:43]
> 
> And of course the last few months have seen further changes to improve efficiency and operations. I can tell you with full confidence that we are ensuring medical foods, medical products, and foods are safe, effective, and accessible for Americans and their family. And this is our top priority. 
> 
> I will also note that we've been operating under paradigms that are frequently part of a change of administration and as well as new priorities that are emerging. And we recognize that this has impacted our collaboration. 
> 
> For example, I know our current travel restrictions have impacted contract audits that help your programs conform to regulatory program standards. And we're working on an exception to the restriction affecting these audits. 
> 
> I want to thank the states that have worked with our divisions to find creative solutions, to accomplish some audits like state inspectors and auditors traveling to where the FDA investigator was located, or the state inspector picking up our investigator to conduct the audit. 
> 
> Our divisions will work with you to make a plan to meet all of your audit requirements.
> 
> ...
> 
> Elizabeth Miller, FDA [00:28:05]
> 
> And all of you know we have faced challenges with the loss of some of our staff, and this is not new for the federal government and more specifically for our food inspectorate.
> 
> Our staffing levels have fluctuated over the years, and I know our state cha partners face similar hiring and retention challenges for highly qualified staff. 
> 
> We're exploring different ways to expand our operational staff. You may have seen the most recent investigator announcement that was specific to the food inspectorate program. Despite the hiring freeze, we were able to get a public safety exception.
> 
> ...
> 
> Kyle Diamantas, FDA [00:55:46]
> 
> We're in a little bit of a unique spot in the human foods program, given that we did go through a large scale reorganization in October of last year. That reorganization unified FDA's previously fractured food work in portfolios and created the human foods program, but standing up the program did leave a number of gaps and unfilled positions. And of course, on top of this year's departures and attrition, we do have some gaps there that we are working to catch up on and fill those positions as much as possible. 
> 
> I am proud to say, we have made strides in ensuring our review work, our labs, our inspectors and our compliance teams have had very limited impact to date and are running full speed ahead. And we're also pleased to be on a path to start filling some critical review hires, having just released a series of job announcements, less than 10 days ago. And we're confident that that those will help us fill backfill those who have retired or moved on to other opportunities and specifically, we're prioritizing filling critical roles among our food inspectorate, I'm sure Elizabeth will reference, as well as our inspectorate adjacent roles and reviewers to help support our postmarket chem safety initiatives. 
> 
> So, we are hoping to post even more announcements in the very near future. So we're really excited about the future on training hiring and retaining key staff.

## From CDC webinar with testing laboratories

- **Date:** occurred June 16, 2025

> Natalie Thornburg, CDC [00:07:35]
> 
> If patterns of transmission and seasonality reflect what we've seen in recent years, we could expect a summer, fall wave.
> 
> Last year, if you look at the COVID data tracker, we started seeing an increase in positivity, right at the very end of June, July. I'm sorry. That's right there. Very end of, well kind of started in May, June, and we saw a peak of up to almost 20% peak in August, and in the previous year, late June, July, and we saw a peak kind of in late August as well. 
> 
> So we may in the coming weeks start to see an increase in COVID activity if it is like more recent years. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Natalie Thornburg, CDC [00:09:02]
> 
> If you'll think way back when we originally developed Nowcast, we had one week reporting periods, data bins, and when we kind of saw our reduction in sequences about two, three years ago, we expanded our data bins to two weeks and we're now expanding our data bins to four weeks. 
> 
> And then we'll plan on doing updates every four weeks thereafter. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Natalie Thornburg, CDC [00:10:27]
> 
> What is NB dot 8.1. Well, it has been circulating internationally for a couple of months. It was prevalent in other parts of the world, earlier this spring. And it does now seem to be increasing in proportionality in the United States. 
> 
> If you look at our dendogram on the COVID data tracker, it kind of sits in an odd place it sits here. So it is a sub lineage of something called XDV.1. It looks like it's quite different than everything else that's been circulating since winter of 23, 24 has been JN.1. 
> 
> But it's actually very similar to these viruses. This is not accurately-- this location in the dendogram does not accurately represent how different it is. It is XDV.1 is a recombination event between JN.1 and an XBB virus, which is why it's sort of rooted upstream of JN.1, but it is very, very similar to XEC, which is the lineage that was most prevalent, sort of during that large peak in the fall of 2024.
> 
> Notably, it has two substitutions in the spike protein that are a little different. It's got one at residue 435. We're seeing that substitution pop up in several lineages. So that's indicating that it's got some sort of selective advantage. And then there's a substitution at 478 in the spike protein, which is a little bit unique to NB.1.8.1. 
> 
> Now there's -- there is a little bit of data, some laboratory data looking at sort of like cross neutralization of current lineages. And there's no data that indicates that this virus is antigenically much very different than anything else that is currently circulating. 
> 
> So everything else that's circulating and has been circulating for about a year, year and a half are all descended from JN.1, which is the current vaccine strain, JN.1. 
> 
> So this is, it does seem to have a little bit of a selective advantage, but it doesn't seem to be dramatically different than anything else that has circulated in the past year and a half. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Natalie Thornburg, CDC [00:13:11]
> 
> So we like to have about 3,000 to accurately detect new emerging lineages and to use for Nowcast modeling. We like to have about 3,000. 
> 
> In the most, I think the past two times we've done this analysis, we've only had about 500, so we are still not going to have the number that we like to have, but a thousand is much better than 500. 
> 
> Now, notably we only use sequences that CDC generates, or that are tagged as baseline in public repositories. 
> 
> There are a lot of sequences that are in there that aren't tagged baseline. So we don't know if they could be from outbreaks or something specific. 
> 
> So we don't use those in our analysis because we don't know that they are representative of everything that is circulating in the community.
> 
> ...
> 
> Natalie Thornburg, CDC [00:15:59]
> 
> We don't have any data to indicate the symptoms are any different than any other lineage that has circulated previously.
> 
> ...
> 
> Brian Wakeman, CDC [00:19:03]
> 
> There are 1,197 confirmed measles cases in 35 different jurisdictions with the largest outbreak centered in Texas, specifically west Texas.
> 
> Additional cases have been seeded from the outbreak in Texas, as well as related outbreaks in Mexico and Canada. Additionally, measles importation from international travel continues, especially as the busy summer of travel season ramps up.
> 
> ...
> 
> Brian Wakeman, CDC [00:20:07]
> 
> As you can see the number of confirmed measles cases is significantly higher than 2023 and 2024. And we're currently on pace to eclipse the 1,274 cases of measles that we saw in 2019, with a large outbreak concentrated in New York. And we're also on pace to be the greatest number of measles cases since the early 90's. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Brian Wakeman, CDC [00:24:36]
> 
> So these days, most U.S. measles cases are detected by PCR, typically performed on NP and OP swabs, but can also be detected in urine. PCR is most commonly done in public health laboratories, but can also be done in commercial laboratories. 
> 
> Quick turnaround time for testing is crucial. Specimens are ideally collected within three days of rash onset for optimal sensitivity, but PCR can be positive up to 10 days after rash onset. 
> 
> It's best to collect specimens for RT-PCR as soon as possible after rash onset to optimize detection, proper specimen collection storage, and processing's important to maintain the stability. RT-PCR has a much higher sensitivity and specificity than serology, as most people know, but false positives can occur, but it's much less common. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Brian Wakeman, CDC [00:25:43]
> 
> We've been getting some questions about primer mismatch with some measles variants that in the past have shown a 3UC mutation. That mismatch is fixed by adding a reverse primary containing the mismatch at a 50 50 ratio. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Brian Wakeman, CDC [00:34:02]
> 
> There's only been 14 of those variants detected in the U.S. since 2023 and none have been detected in 2025. There was a paper put out by the CDC, and you can email us at CDC measles lab at CDC dot gov, but the paper is Beck et al 2024, Eurosurveillance paper.

> I'm grateful to have been part of such important and effective work that has provided decision-makers with real-time, high-quality, rigorous scientific evidence that have been used to track disease severity over time, tailor vaccine messaging to groups at highest risk for severe disease and provide critical inputs for vaccine cost- effectiveness analyses. 
> 
> Of all the work we have accomplished, I am most proud of how COVID-NET and RSV-NET hospitalization data, presented at nearly every public ACIP meeting since 2020, have been critical drivers of COVID-19 and RSV vaccine policy in recent years. As an infectious disease physician dedicated to ensuring that decision-makers can develop evidence-based immunization strategies to protect individuals and communities from vaccine- preventable diseases, I deeply value the impact we have created together. I have complete confidence that RESP-NET will continue to be a critical resource and that the RESP-NET team - including CDC and our academic and state and local health partners - will continue to generate epidemiologic and clinical data of the highest quality. Unfortunately, I no longer have confidence that these data will be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions.

> Martin Makary, FDA [01:29:26]
> 
> You want your body to be in a low inflammatory state. That means avoiding simple sugars over-- complex sugars are slower to absorb, so they're not as bad as the refined sugars, but generally speaking, you want a low carbohydrate load in your system. If you want go mega healthy and try keto, I think it takes a lot of discipline, but certainly any of those diets, be it south beach keto, low carb, you name it. Anything is gonna be better than the standard American diet or what we call SAD, the sad diet. 
> 
> So any of those, those are all pro-health things. Avoid the processed foods, avoid things that are premade and you sort of pull out of a can or and cook, generally speaking, things that you can cook are going to be healthier than things that you can just buy and eat. 
> 
> Be careful about pesticides, Roundup, there's a report showing that it probably causes cancer. That's what the report said. They got to be careful, of course, with lawyers, I can just tell you right off the bat, I avoid it all together. 
> 
> Roundup is a weed killer and it's on almost all these non-organic things that we eat: produce, fruit, vegetables, you name it. So a strawberry has been sprayed on average 15 times.
> 
> Question [01:30:54]
> 
> How do you avoid the pesticides?
> 
> Martin Makary, FDA [01:30:56]
> 
> So you want to buy organic produce when, especially when there's the peel that you're going to be consuming the peel when, when buying fish, you want to avoid fish that are farmed in closed environments because the heavy metals build up in the fish, fish can be very healthy, omega three fats are good. They balance out the omega three omega six imbalance that we have in our modern diet.
> 
> ...
> 
> Martin Makary, FDA [01:32:21]
> 
> I don't subscribe to the modern day phenomena of, produced by the food industry, that everyone has to eat a large breakfast in the morning. I don't think we were made like that. I think, I don't think our biome was designed for it. 
> 
> I think that hunters and gatherers would get these large sums of food and then sort of eat large meals. And I think that's why you're seeing the micro and mini-fasting movement grow in the United States. 
> 
> There was a small animal experiment that showed if you sort of segmentally fast, the animals that they could have a better longevity. So it created a lot of interest. Of course it wasn't-- it was kind of a sloppy study, but maybe there's something to fasting. 
> 
> If you think about how we were designed, how we sort of changed over time, did we really have food in four and five hour increments? All of our waking hours? No. 
> 
> So these, when the food industry puts these things out like milk, right, we have to drink milk. Why are we drinking milk? Were we really meant to drink so much cows milk? Is that how-- all right, this is messing up the human biome. And so I like either macadamia milk, I like almond milk or a mix of different types of milk. 
> 
> I don't love coconut milk that much, although anything with coconut is generally very healthy. You can put it on your skin, use it as suntan lotion, cook with it. It's great. Anything coconut's great.

## HHS spokesperson on sharing data with Medicaid

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon
- **Date:** received June 13, 2025

> HHS and CMS take the integrity of the Medicaid program and the protection of American taxpayer dollars extremely seriously. With respect to the recent data sharing between CMS and DHS, HHS acted entirely within its legal authority – and in full compliance with all applicable laws – to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them.
> 
> This action is not unprecedented. What is unprecedented is the systemic neglect and policy failures under the Biden-Harris administration that opened the floodgates for illegal immigrants to exploit Medicaid – and forced hardworking Americans to foot the bill. In states like California, these failures are now on full display. While millions of Americans struggle to afford care, the state of California has aggressively expanded its taxpayer-funded health benefits to cover illegal immigrants – directly defying the intent of federal Medicaid law. California provides free, full-scope Medicaid coverage to low-income illegal immigrants, no questions asked. The Biden administration looked the other way and allowed federal funds to potentially flow into a system that is ripe for abuse.
> 
> The Biden administration not only failed to enforce the law—it actively created the conditions for abuse. Through rulemaking and policy guidance, it weakened state oversight, discouraged immigration verification, and tied the hands of CMS and state agencies alike. These deliberate choices have cost American taxpayers dearly and allowed benefits to be siphoned away from the vulnerable citizens they were designed to serve.
> 
> That ends now.
> 
> Under the leadership of Dr. Oz, CMS is aggressively cracking down on states that may be misusing federal Medicaid funds to subsidize care for illegal immigrants. This oversight effort – supported by lawful interagency data sharing with DHS – is focused on identifying waste, fraud, and systemic abuse. We are not only protecting taxpayer dollars – we are restoring credibility to one of America’s most vital programs. The American people deserve accountability. HHS is delivering it.

> 
> Unlike the old ACIP that had become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine, this group will go where the science takes them. They will demand definitive safety and efficacy data for any new vaccine recommendations. They will also review safety and efficacy data for the current vaccine schedule.
> 
> Before starting work on ACIP, the new members’ ethics agreements will be made public. Every ACIP member will be vetted in accordance with their ethics agreement before they are permitted to participate in each meeting agenda item.
> 
> The new ACIP members with experience serving on similar HHS expert panels include:
> 
> Martin Kulldorff, MD, PhD, served on the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Subgroup of ACIP and on the FDA’s Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee.
> <br>Cody Meissner, MD, served on both ACIP and the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.

## ACIP FAQ shared with stakeholders

- **Source:** document
- **Attribution:** obtained by CBS News
- **Date:** received June 11, 2025

> ACIP FAQ
> 
> What Authority Does the Secretary Have to Reform ACIP?
> 
> 42 USC § 217a give the Secretary the authority to establish discretionary advisory committees, such as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). As a Federal Advisory Committee covered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act and its implementing regulations, “advisory committee members serve at the pleasure of the appointing or inviting authority. Membership terms are at the sole discretion of the appointing or inviting authority.” 41 C.F.R. § 120-3.130(a).
> 
> Why Did the Secretary Do This?
> 
> The American people elected President Trump to support a review of vaccine policy to improve public trust in vaccines. The Biden administration attempted to block a full scientific review of vaccines by appointing members on the ACIP at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) before President Trump assumed office. The previous administration tried to prevent membership changes until 2028. This action will restore regular order to the important vaccine committee. Secretary Kennedy is restoring transparency and gold standard science to ACIP.
> 
> How was the current ACIP Roster Appointed?
> 
> All the current ACIP members are Biden appointees. 13 were appointed and one term was extended in 2024, and three appointments were made in 2021. Several were appointed after the election in the “Midnight Hour” of the Biden administration.
> 
> Does This Affect Private Insurance Coverage, Medicaid, or the Vaccines for Children Program?
> 
> This decision does not affect insurance coverage or any program that relies on ACIP recommendations.
> 
> Does This Affect the Vaccine Schedules?
> 
> This decision does not affect the childhood vaccine schedule.
> 
> How Are New Members Being Selected?
> 
> New members will be selected through a rigorous examination of their scientific credentials and a comprehensive ethics review for potential conflicts of interest.
> 
> Will the June ACIP Meeting Still Go Forward?
> 
> The June ACIP meeting that was announced on Friday, June 6th will go forward as scheduled.
> 
> Is There Precedent for HHS Secretaries to Use their Authority to Make Changes to the Composition of this Panel?
> 
> What President Biden did to ACIP was truly unprecedented, including stacking the ACIP in the final year of a presidential term through “Midnight Hour” appointments. Increasing ACIP membership beyond the historical 15 or 16 members, was also unprecedented. 
> 
> Secretary Kennedy is restoring the Committee to precedent and reconstituting ACIP into an objective scientific body, rather than a political forum
> 
> Does this Personnel Change Affect ACIP Procedures?
> 
> No.
> 
> Are the Terms of New Members Staggered or will there Need to be a Completely New Board After New Members Serve Their 4-Year Term?
> 
> The new members will be appointed with staggered two- to four-year terms to ensure that ACIP returns to regular order and retains institutional knowledge.
>

## HHS secretary at USDA event, talks about ACIP

> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [05:26:58]
> 
> In terms of changes to ACIP, this had been a long time coming. 
> 
> More than two decades ago, Congress investigated ACIP, the government oversight committee found that, for example, that year, which was 2003, gave one example that 4 out of the 5 people who added the rotavirus vaccine to the schedule had direct financial interest in that vaccine. One of those individuals voted the rotavirus onto the vaccine and sold his rotavirus vaccine that he had in development for $186 million. He said he won the lottery.
> 
> That year, Congress says that 97% of the people on ACIP had undisclosed conflicts. So people have known about this for years. 
> 
> You know, probably the worst example of malevolent malpractice has been adding all of these new products to this schedule without doing pre-licensing safety studies. In 1986, there were 11 vaccines on the schedule. Today, a compliant child must take between 69 and 92 vaccines to stay in school in some states. And not one of them has been safety tested in a pre licensing placebo controlled trial. And that is just malpractice. 
> 
> So the people who are in charge of that are now gone, and we're going to bring people onto the ACIP panel, not anti-vaxxers, who are bringing people on who are credentialed scientists, who are highly credentialed physicians, who are going to do evidence based medicine, who are going to be objective and who are going to follow the science and make critical public health determinations for our children based upon the best science.

> BALDWIN 10:31:00
>
> Dr. Bhattacharya, I'm struggling to find a reason why NIH would implement this forward funding policy. How is this proposal anything but intentionally sabotaging biomedical research? 
>
> BHATTACHARYA 
>
> So, Senator, a couple of things. So, one is, regarding funding for this year, Congress allocated the money. My job is to make sure that the money goes to excellent research projects. My intention is that we will spend--
>
> BALDWIN
>
> I'm asking about the forward funding proposal that disguises even deeper cuts in the NIH budget than the budget submission would suggest.
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> Yeah, so I just wanted to preface my answer to that, because you asked that also. But, as regarding forward funding, that's a budget proposal. I mean, again, the--
>
> BALDWIN
>
> Well, you don't deny that it reduces the amount that will be spent on biomedical research next year by an even deeper amount than the 18 billion dollars, 40% cut already. 
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> Right, so the way the forward funding works, right now we have multi-year projects that we fund. And forward funding says we will allocate the money for those multi-year projects this year, rather than in the out years. In principle--
>
> BALDWIN
>
> And so, if it's a four-year project, three of the years will sit in an escrow account and not be spent next year. Again, further diminishing the amount that will be spent on biomedical research. 
>
> BHATTACHARYA 
>
> I think, I mean--  I think the thing is, in the long run, what it does is allow you to spend more money and have more flexibility for new research projects. That's because what it says-- 
>
> BALDWIN  
>
> That's funny math.   
>
> BHATTACHARYA  
>
> I mean, it's just the math. I mean, I'm an economist, also. What it does is it says, look, let's allocate the money this year so that next year, the money isn't tied up for-- on previous years' projects. That's, in the long run.  
>
> I think, as I said, I'm happy to work with Congress and looking forward to working with Congress on this. This is a budget proposal, not a final thing.  
>
> I think if I had to start and redesign the system again from the start, allowing more flexibility as new scientific opportunities come up with the forward funding model makes-- allows that to happen, actually, more than the current model where large fractions of the NIH budget are tied up with old projects.   
>
> So I think that-- but as the transition in, it really matters how we do it, and so I'm absolutely really glad to work with Congress on that, to make sure that there's no disruptions.  
>
> …
>
> 10:41:49 DURBIN
>
> When you look at specific schools, of course, I’m concerned about Illinois. We have great research there. 
>
> Northwestern University has not received a penny for NIH grants in 11 weeks. 1,359 NIH awards to Northwestern have been frozen or terminated, halting $81 million in research to date. 
>
> I could go through some of the specifics of this research. But it includes $9 million in clinical trials for brain cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, childhood cancer. How are you able to reconcile these budget decisions, with the reality of research and what it means to alleviate suffering, and more importantly, they give people hope, if research is underway, you at least have the hope that maybe there'll be a cure, maybe in the lifetime of someone I love. 
>
> How can you walk away from that?
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> It was my intention not to walk away from that. I mean, I think that-- 
>
> DURBIN
>
> But the budget speaks for itself. You cut $18 billion in research.
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> Senator, the budget is a collaboration between Congress and the administration. So, you know, I look forward to talking about the advances that NIH researchers have made.
>
> I mean, I think the transition has been a very bumpy time, and I don't mean to, like, downplay that, but there have been opportunities for reform for how the biomedical research enterprise works. 
>
> I think the decisions about Northwestern happened before I got into office, but-- let me just say that--
>
> DURBIN
>
> The buck stops in your office. 
>
> BHATTACHARYA 
>
> I know it does, so let me just say that--
>
> DURBIN
>
> Don't blame another person. 
>
> BHATTACHARYA 
>
> I'm not blaming anybody. 
>
> DURBIN
>
> We're asking you, and you're in charge. 
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> Senator, I agree with that. So let me just say that I think that the way that the universities operated during the pandemic wasn't always-- didn't always make it easy for scientists to--to do their work. I can tell you that personally, from being a professor. And I think, some of the—
>
> …
>
> DURBIN
>
> But eliminating grants, eliminating research, how can that solve the problem? 
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> So, I think that I'm very hopeful that a resolution can be made with the universities where those decisions have been-- those grants have been paused. 
>
> I've worked very hard to make sure, for instance, at Harvard, we didn't pause grants, for instance, to the medical centers, because there were clinical trials going on. 
>
> But I think that this is-- I'm very hopeful that these universities where these pauses have happened will come to terms so that we can move forward with the agenda that I think you and I both share.
>
> …
>
> BHATTACHARYA 11:15:38
>
> Senator, can I just address the HIV? Because I am absolutely committed to the-- in 2019, President Trump issued a challenge for us to eliminate the threat of HIV in this country. And we've had a 22% reduction in HIV transmission since then.
>
> We now have the technological tools to do that. And I've been working on developing a program to actually implement this vision, so we can use—
>
> MURRAY
>
> But you did terminate the HIV research at Fred Hutch that, again, was on the cusp of a treatment for 6,000 patients nationwide. You did do that. 
>
> BHATTACHARYA 
>
> I'd have to get back to you on that. 
>
> MURRAY
>
> You did do that. 
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> Senator, I mean, I think we actually have now the chance, with existing technologies, lenacapavir and other technologies, to actually address—
>
> MURRAY
>
> I'm delighted to hear that, but I'm just telling you what clinical trials have been terminated. And I’m asking you this because we have to write an appropriations bill.
>
> …
>
> SHAHEEN 11:26:32
>
> We had this conversation, as you pointed out, and that's why it was so puzzling to me to see what the budget proposes in terms of slashing the funding for NIDDK.
>
> So help me understand why that is and how that's going to improve our research into diabetes? 
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> Senator, I think the budget is a negotiation, a collaboration between the administration and Congress, and you'll have your say.
>
> I think for my job is to make sure that the funds that you all appropriate to me make—are-- go to advancing and meeting the health needs of the American people.
>
> I think that that's-- that's a productive thing. I'm hearing from basically everybody that the NIH is a valued – is really valued in Congress, and I find that gratifying. 
>
> I value the NIH, and so you know, I don't-- the administration, President Trump has committed the that the U.S. be the leading nation in biomedicine in the 21st century, and I entirely support that goal.
>
> SHAHEEN
>
> Well, I do too, but it's hard to understand how we're going to get there when the budget slashes funding, particularly in critical areas of research.
>
> …
>
> BHATTACHARYA 11:32:56
>
> Senator, I've established a process for appeals for those grant terminations and decisions. And hundreds of people have appealed. 
>
> It won't take 18 months. It'll take weeks to get through those appeals. We've reversed many of them. 
>
> I mean, I didn't take this job to terminate grants. I took this job to make sure that we do the research that advances the health needs of the American people 
>
> SCHATZ
>
> Okay, so give me, like, a time frame for processing all of them. 
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> I mean, it's hard to promise a specific timeframe, but it won't take-- it won't be years, it'll be weeks.
>
> I mean, I spent the last couple of weeks-- last few weeks, I think it was, like, a month ago, we set up the appeals process.
>
> And they've been working through those numbers, those grant applications. 
>
> SCHATZ
>
> Can we agree that we shouldn't do it that way again?
>
> BHATTACHARYA
>
> I mean, I—
>
> SCHATZ
>
> I know you have to survive in this administration, but can we agree that this is not the most helpful way to do things? 
>
> BHATTACHARYA

> I mean, I think a lot of those decisions were made before I got in.

> QUESTION 03:34:45
> 
> Do you believe that some vaccines save lives?
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 03:34:53
> 
> Yes. Many vaccines save lives.
> 
> QUESTION 03:34:56
> 
> Do you believe that some vaccines that are given to children save lives?
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 03:35:01
> 
> Yes.
> 
> QUESTION 03:35:02
> 
> Do you believe that some vaccines are known to be harmful and yet still given?
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 03:35:07
> 
> Let me, let me say a specific one. 
> 
> I think the COVID vaccine for children, in particular, I don't think is net beneficial for kids
> 
> QUESTION 03:35:14
> 
> Not-- but you said not net beneficial? Does that mean it's harmful?
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 03:35:19
> 
> Net harmful.
> 
> QUESTION 03:35:20
> 
> You believe that the COVID vaccine is net harmful--
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 03:35:23
> 
> For-- especially for young men.
> 
> QUESTION 03:35:25
> 
> Can you define the age cutoff there?
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 03:35:27
> 
> We can argue about this. Like there's a scientific-- but I think it's pretty clear that, I don't know, somewhere between age 12 and 30 or something for boys and men, young men, the COVID vaccine is probably net harmful.
> 
> Again, with full boys who have no other underlying conditions and all that, there’s--
> 
> QUESTION 03:35:46
> 
> Not obese, no heart condition--
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 03:35:48
> 
> Well, I mean, even obese, you have to like, look at the numbers. 
> 
> I mean, I there's lots of debates and fights over this in scientific literature. So I hesitate to like actually give you a specific age threshold, but I think just as a general matter, there exist groups for whom the COVID vaccine was net harmful, specifically young men.
> 
> QUESTION 03:36:05
> 
> Do you think there's any reason to think that the adjuvants that essentially what the vaccines are suspended in, not the vaccines themselves, are potentially harmful? I've heard this. I don't-- I am personally not aware of any strong evidence for it.
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 03:36:21
> 
> I think these are one, these are the kind of things that ought to be investigated, but it's very difficult to investigate just because of the sort of like political aura around vaccines, where if you ask, if you are-- if you really do investigate it and find something, that's the public health authorities don't like, you're going to have trouble. 
> 
> I think there-- I don't know the answer to that question, from a scientific point of view.
> 
> …
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 04:08:57
> 
> I think that there's good evidence on the MMR vaccine that, of failing to find a link with autism.
> 
> There’s, and I don't know the full extent of this literature, so I shouldn't comment too much, but I've -- when I've looked I haven't seen quite the same level of evidence for some of the other vaccines failing-- just haven't that again, they just haven't looked.
> 
> As a general matter, I think it's an unlikely, just from a biological point of view, unlikely to be the main reason why autism-- the rise in autism, which is now well documented that you talked about, has occurred. 
> 
> So to me, the question then is thinking about autism, you're asking, and you want to tell parents, answer for parents, well, what does cause what does, has led to the rise in the prevalence of autism? 
> 
> The  honest answer is, I don't know, you focused on what're focused now in this conversation on just one potential cause, vaccines. To me, it's unlikely that they are the reason for the rise in the cause of autism. But there are many other potential hypotheses for the rise in the prevalence of autism that I've seen, so alterations, the gut microbiome I've seen.
> 
> …
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 04:11:44
> 
> Unless you understand the etiology, it might be different etiology for kids in different parts of the spectrum, then you're never gonna have good answers, both for prevention and also for therapies. 
> 
> So it's that question that Bobby Kennedy's asked me to answer or try to get an answer. And that President Trump has asked to get an answer and I think it's appropriate because if you ask me what is, I mean, we just talked about vaccines as a potential cause I think it's unlikely to be the cause, but you can see my mind is open, for depending on the levels of evidence I've seen.
> 
> Now, this is not my area, right. Just, I should say this, like I'm saying this as someone who's now like tried to wade into it some just to get a sense of it. But, as I've waited into it, it's very, very clear that there is not a scientific question, a consensus answering the question of what causes the rise in autism or what is the etiology of autism.
> 
> …
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 04:15:33
> 
> So what I've done is I've organized an initiative inside the NIH to address this question of the etiology of autism.
> 
> QUESTION: 
> 
> Not limited to vaccines?
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 
> 
> No, wide ranging, it includes basic science work. It includes epidemiological work, it'll include environmental exposure work, includes all -- and we'll bring together data sets that will make available to the researchers. We will have a competition among scientists, just like the normal NIH way with peer review panels, to ask who should get the awards.
> 
> We'll have a dozen or more scientific teams asking the question, what is the etiology of autism. We’ll have that, I think that normally it takes a year or longer to set up a thing like this. We’ll, by September, we'll have like an open competition for these scientific projects. 
> 
> And, you can’t rush science, but hoping within a relatively short period of time, who knows how long exactly depends on how science works. We'll have a much better understanding of the etiology of autism than we have at this current moment.
> 
> …
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 04:16:49
> 
> On vaccines, can I say one thing?
> 
> Now, I don't want to—as the NIH director, I don't want to put my thumb on the scale on any part of these potential etiologies, right. As I already said, I'm not particularly an expert in this area. 
> 
> And so even if I were to put my thumb on the scale, would be from, not from the point of view of expertise, it would just be the point of view of, like, I just happened to read the literature and I was impressed by X, Y, or Z. 
> 
> But if I were to put my thumb on the scale, I think it would make it more difficult, A for scientists to ask the question, honestly, because they want to impress the NIH director or something and then B for the public to trust the result at the end.
> 
> I want an open-minded-- So this is why like I—I was asked, well, if you don't believe that vaccine, these vaccines cause autism, why would you allow that people to ask that as a part of the research agenda? And my answer is that a lot of people, especially in the public, but that, and even some scientists who disagree with me and I want them to have their say, I want an honest conversation. 
> 
> I think that if you have an honest evaluation, you're not going find that that vaccines are the primary reason for the cause of the rise autism you're going to be, it's going to be something much more fundamental and complicated, but I don't want the results to be disbelieved because I put my thumb on the scale.
> 
> …
> 
> BHATTACHARYA 04:18:25
> 
> The other thing about the initiative, it's very important to understand we're working with autistic parents, we're working with the autism community, right? 
> 
> It's—a lot of times scientists, when they study things, we put ourselves above and we like, it's like, we're like examining amoeba or something on a slide. When you do population research, you have to work with the communities that you actually trying to help. And that's exactly the spirit of this. 
> 
> We’re going to work with communities of autistic kids and parents. And we're going to apply rigorous research methods with control groups and just the normal of sort of like high quality, the term of art nowadays is gold standard science, like we're going to try apply gold standard science to this and subject it to the same kind of replicability standards I want all science subject to.

## FDA infant formula expert panel

- **Date:** streamed June 4, 2025

> Steven Abrams, Panelist [10:12:53]
> 
> There are some basic things like iron, calcium and phosphorus that have a tremendous need to be updating and harmonize as best possible with European and Codex, which are World Health Organization standards. 
> 
> Our standards for these nutrients in many cases are quite different. And just to give you an example, the iron in infant formula in the United States is much higher than it is allowed to even be in Europe. And the current science supports the European perspective. 
> 
> So it's a chance for us to take a look at every nutrient, not just the seed oils and say, do we need to set our limits? Where do we need to look at what needs to be done? And can we harmonize so that the world sees formula in one way and families, as they're trying to say, well, I want to buy a formula that's made in Europe can understand that the formulas made in the United States meet those same standards for them. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Marty Makary, FDA [10:03:16]
> 
> We really want to learn from you. We desperately need to innovate in this space and that means regulatory innovation. 
> 
> So we want to hear your ideas unprompted, unfiltered, tell us exactly what you think needs to be done to improve the health of babies and children in the United States and worldwide through the regulatory authorities that we have. 
> 
> And I mean that sincerely as moms want to see more options for formula, they want to see formula options without seed oils. They want to see formula options without corn syrup. They want to see formula options without added sugar, and some of those are already on the market. 
> 
> And in other spaces, we, as a regulatory body can help facilitate some of that innovation. 
> 
> There's been almost no change to the monograph for baby formula since 1998, with the exception of adding selenium. 
> 
> Now, in my view, the field of medical science does not stay stagnant for 26 years in any space. And it's hard to believe that is the only sort of enlightened moment that we've had in understanding how best to nourish children. 
> 
> There are people who are concerned about the heavy metal levels in formula. And I think for foremost to this entire conversation, we have to acknowledge that we all want the same thing. 
> 
> There are no malicious actors and we have to see the best in everybody, and this should not be a us versus them with any stakeholder group or any innovator developer or company out there. 
> 
> This is an expert forum to ask how can we think collectively about what's best for some of the most vulnerable in our nation.
> 
> Gandhi once said that the true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members, our seniors and our children. 
> 
> And so, we look forward to your ideas. We are going to take them very seriously. 
> 
> This is not a horse and pony show where you get to say what you think. And then we ignore it and say that we had a forum. This is a true listening session. 
> 
> And so we are going to take your ideas and go back to our subject matter experts and the terrific career scientists at the FDA who have been working on this and our policy staff and ask, what can we do differently? 
> 
> ...
> 
> Tom Brenna, Panelist [10:20:29]
> 
> So now I get onto the topic of seed oils. Well, seed oils are one sort of oil. There's two other kinds of oils, fruit oils and let's say cows milk fat, and you can maybe think of other ones, but those are the major ones. 
> 
> And the thing I want to -- the one point that I want to make scientifically here is that it's not just about some problem with seed oils. They're-- it's not all seed oils are the same. 
> 
> So in this study, rhesus monkeys, pregnant rhesus monkeys were fed formulas that had all of their fat that came from either soybean oil or from safflower oil, both seed oils on the hit parade these days. 
> 
> And, so when the infants were born, they were weaned to those essentially formulas where that was the only source of fat and what they measured was visual acuity.
> 
> Now visual acuity in humans or primates or pretty much any other mammal is a measure of brain development, not just retinal development. And what you find is that with safflower oil, which is very omega-3 deficient, much less, much slower development of visual acuity, and that's the lower line there, and I don't really have a pointer, but if you get to the end there's a red circle, and that corresponds on the eye chart to about a 2100, on our familiar scale where 2020 is normal vision. But in soybean oil, which has some omega 3, it's got the plant one, but it has some omega 3. They have a vision at 12 weeks of age of 2050, so much, much better.

> And, as it turns out, if you give these same animals a source of omega 3's, EPA and DHA, so fish oil, classic fish oil, when they get a little bit older, let's say starting at about a year, the ones that on the lower curve don't recover. So you've gotta get this right early on. That's another salient point we have to make. 
> 
> So it's not just about seed oils, it's about what we replaced them with. Something like 60 or 70% of the edible oils in the United States are seed oils. And so if we shut it off tomorrow, domestic seed oil, I should say. So, there are things we can do to make it better. There's no question about that.

> ...

> Michael Goran, Panelist [11:05:06]
> 
> The FDA regulates these older regulations that we're talking about, they only regulate the amount of carbohydrate, not the type of carbohydrate. So during the last 20 or 30 years, there's been all kinds of different types of carbohydrates introduced into infant formula. And in fact, now today, the majority of infant formula sold in the U.S. is made with non lactose sugars, such as sucrose, which is ordinary table sugar. But most of the non lactose formulas are in fact made with corn syrup solids, which is a glucose polymer, meaning it's a big molecule of glucose, sugars joint together, in one big polymer. So there's no, there's no galactose there. So it's a very different type of sugar, it is handled quite differently in the body.
> 
> And, this I think has occurred through a series of concerning situations, mostly due to misunderstanding by the public, as well as advertising and marketing claims, based on the concept of lactose intolerance in babies. So these are often sold as gentle formulas or marketed towards fussy babies, but actually this-- the fact is that almost all full term babies can digest lactose, which is the only carbohydrate energy source in breast milk. 
> 
> Now, in addition, um, emerging research just quite recently, probably in the last five or 10 years is beginning to show that these non lactose carbohydrates in formula are linked to a number of different outcomes, including alteration of the infant microbiome, which is the colonization of gut of microbes in the gut changes and taste and food preference because these glucose polymers from corn syrup are much sweeter than lactose and also a study that we published a couple of years ago in collaboration with WIC, so it was a very large population, showing an increased risk of obesity in children who were fed formula made with corn syrup versus traditional formula made with lactoses.
> 
> ...
> 
> Michael Goran, Panelist [11:10:02]
> 
> I think there should be consideration just like the EU is doing to determine an allowable level of glucose polymers that that would be okay to deal with, to deal with as a, and or a required level of lactose should be determined. 
> 
> It's very hard for consumers to know, other than looking at the ingredient list on the back of the product, whether either lactose or milk sugar would be listed as an ingredient or something like corn syrup, it would be listed as the ingredient. There's no other labeling law. 
> 
> I think there should be consideration if there is lactose intolerance. I don't know why there was a decision made to go straight to corn syrup to resolve that issue. That's not what adults with lactose intolerance would do. So there should-- could be a consideration to break apart the lactose into the residual sugars of glucose and galactose, as probably a healthier issue than using corn syrup. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Steven Abrams, Panelist [11:16:17]
> 
> There are a lot of issues involved in this regulation. So for example, labeling approaches and legalities are different in Europe than they are in the United States about average versus minimum content. So I think that we can't just take European or EFSA guidelines and just turn them into the U.S., and that's why the FDA is here, but I think the FDA does need to reach out the content experts people in-- I mean, we have people about fat. We have people involved in carbohydrates. We have people involved in minerals, people involved in oligosaccharides. And I think each of those are kind of their own scientific groups and interacting with established groups, which include groups like American Society for Nutrition, American Academy of Pediatrics is helpful. But I think ultimately there are topic experts that are going to be need to be reached out to it. We can't-- I think there's a lot to be gained from trying to harmonize as much as possible with European guidelines. I think that would be tremendously valuable for everyone, but there are differences in how we regulate formulas and how we label them and that need to be addressed in doing that. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Tim Sentongo, Panelist [11:27:21]
> 
> We do have pretty compelling data that shows that excess protein is a big contributor to rapid weight gain because the infant formulas have the same caloric density. The different components are matched differently. Some fats are blended, some carbohydrates have corn starch syrup, others are lactose. But the big differences at that time between breast milk and infant formula is breast milk has about 1.4 grams of protein per a hundred calories. Whereas standard infant formulas have more than that. And the guidelines give a ranges higher as 4.5 grams of protein per a hundred calories. 
> 
> So you can just see that that excess protein intake, clearly programs -- has something to do with the programming of how children grow in the first couple of years of life. And if you follow these children, you realize that if you're over-- if you're very big in the first three years of your life, you'll likely be bigger overweight during your preschool years during your school age years. And if you enter adolescence as being overweight, that probability of turning that around is gets less and less and less again with all the additional environmental things that in our diets and that we choose to make, that programming continues. 
> 
> So clearly the protein data I think is compelling enough. I think the Europeans, I think have had, I think they have more tighter. They have a narrow range of proteins that they recommend. And that's also one of the reasons I believe why cows milk, which has a much high protein content is really discouraged in infants. 
> 
> Of course at another age is encouraged, but even in a controlled amount, because you take too much of it, ultra protein, those kids really get very overweight. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Steven Abrams, Panelist [11:35:50]
> 
> So the FDA over decades has created an immense and overwhelming process to make sure that that formula is safe and it's been extremely effective, but the formula shortage has pointed out that there are times when we needed to bring in formulas that did not go through the full FDA process. Many of which had safely been used overseas for many, many years with excellent testing done using overseas guidance. 
> 
> So I think there is the opportunity for us to take a look and that's what the NASEM panel did and say, how do we make sure that we maintain that absolute level of excellence of FDA review of formula, but also add certain types of flexibility. Do we really need six visits? Do we really need for the growth studies? Do we really need to not enroll anyone who is not only on formula by two weeks of age, all sorts of very strict kind of rules that may be flexible as we bring upon new sources of protein, different types of energy and those sorts of things. 
> 
> And that's what the FDA I think can really take a look at with the scientific world and take a look at what the European experience has been. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Andrea Gilbaugh, Panelist [11:42:16]
> 
> So formula companies marketing is part of the confusion. It confuses healthcare professionals, it confuses families. So if there are limitations on the marketing that they were allowed to do, I think education would be easier for healthcare professionals. 
> 
> They say some really dramatic things like designed to reduce crying in 24 hours. So if that's on a can of formula and you're thinking, okay, well I'm breastfeeding, but if this is designed to reduce crying in 24 hours, maybe I should try this because my baby keeps crying. 
> 
> Another thing that they've said is just what your baby needs and nothing they don't. So I think there's a lot of misleading in the labeling and we need to look at that.
> 
> ...
> 
> Tom Brenna, Panelist [11:48:44]
> 
> I think we can get on with the business of updating our regulations for fatty acids, and get with the rest of the world. And maybe, if we do it right, we might be able to get ahead of the rest of the world, while we're at it, that's the first thing. And those would be the underlying fatty acids. 
> 
> And the second thing is, if we have a chance to have a detailed discussion, and as the commissioner said, not just walking out of here and saying, gee, we did something, but actually getting together and discussing it, we can do something about the seed oil story, which doesn't mean, I don't think getting rid of all seed oils, but giving moms and dads options, which I think is what the point was.

## CDC spokesperson on GII.17 seasonality

> There are currently insufficient historic data to predict whether norovirus GII.17 will remain the dominant genotype and lead to an earlier onset of the norovirus season later this year. In the United States, GII.17 has only circulated at low levels and has never been the dominant norovirus strain. Following the surge of GII.17 strains in Asia and parts of Europe in 2014, the GII.4 Sydney variant re-emerged as the dominant genotype by 2016 with no reports of seasonality change. At this time, there is no clear evidence linking the GII.17 genotype to changes in norovirus seasonality. We will continue to monitor norovirus outbreaks through CaliciNet and will report any early activity or emerging trends through our website https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/php/reporting/calicinet-data.html.

> 08 27 26 MAKARY: Moms want more options for baby formula.
> 
> They want baby formula options with no corn syrup, no seed oils. They want baby formula options with no added sugar. 
> 
> And we've seen no innovation in the baby formula space since 1998, with the exception of simply adding selenium. 
> 
> The research has moved and we have now had great learnings in the medical field, but the regulatory obstacles have not allowed companies to really innovate. So we're going to look at all of it.
> 
> We're going to look at heavy metals in baby formulas, on the-- in the supply chain, you know there was a shortage in the last administration, so we're going to get ahead of it and deliver for moms what they want, which is more options for baby formula.
> 
> QUESTION: Yeah, when my daughter was an infant, I relied on this, and I just trusted-- she had some tummy issues, and so I had to get this one particular formula. But I didn't know what was in it, I just listened to the doctors.
> 
> Do we have seed oils, do we have heavy metals in our formulas?
> 
> MAKARY: Yes, seed oil-- it is almost impossible to find baby formula without seed oils and seed oils are not a naturally occurring substance. 
> 
> You know, in the history of mankind, they did not press seeds and extract the oils and then add a chemical solvent to it, and then bleach it, just to increase the shelf life. 
> 
> And generally it is-- they're believed to be pro-inflammatory. We don't want babies with general body inflammation. 40% of our nation's kids have a chronic condition. Many of those are tied to inflammation and insulin resistance.
> 
> Moms want more options and we're going to deliver.

> Sarah Gebauer, FDA [00:38:07]
> 
> Now that we've issued the final rule to update the criteria for the claim, we are continuing our efforts on developing a healthy symbol, and this would be a visual way that manufacturers could demonstrate that their product meets the healthy criteria. 
> 
> And we've conducted consumer research on a potential healthy symbol to help us understand what would really be helpful to consumers. And you can see some symbols that were tested in the middle of the slide. And symbols can be particularly helpful, for example, for people who are less familiar with nutrition information, by having that visual to let consumers know that a product qualifies for the claim. 
> 
> Finally, we will be working with manufacturers to support implementation of the claim. We see opportunities for using the healthy claim beyond the label and using creative ways to leverage the healthy claim. And we are eager to work with interested groups to support the use of the healthy claim, so that it's really as impactful and helpful as possible to consumers. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Sarah Gebauer, FDA [00:48:27]
> 
> So as mentioned in the presentation, we have been working on developing a healthy symbol. The symbol would be a standardized graphic, and I showed some examples on the slide that manufacturers could use to show that their products meet the healthy criteria. And so it can really be sort of as that quick visual.
> 
> We have conducted two rounds of focus groups and also an experimental study of-- related to a healthy symbol, to really learn what would be the most useful for consumers. And we don't have a specific timeline to share at this point, but again, we are continuing to work on the healthy symbol work.
> 
> Robin McKinnon, FDA [00:49:10]
> 
> Maybe I can just add on there, Sarah, as well. We know that, because I was involved in some of the early work on the healthy symbol, and we found that people-- they were hesitant to engage, especially manufacturers, on the symbol until they had seen the updated criteria. 
> 
> So now it's kind of a natural progression, if you like, to have finalized the updated criteria and then to be turning a focus to the-- towards the symbol.
