> Now that we've issued the final rule to update the criteria for the claim, we are continuing our efforts on developing a healthy symbol, and this would be a visual way that manufacturers could demonstrate that their product meets the healthy criteria. 
> 
> And we've conducted consumer research on a potential healthy symbol to help us understand what would really be helpful to consumers. And you can see some symbols that were tested in the middle of the slide. And symbols can be particularly helpful, for example, for people who are less familiar with nutrition information, by having that visual to let consumers know that a product qualifies for the claim. 
> 
> Finally, we will be working with manufacturers to support implementation of the claim. We see opportunities for using the healthy claim beyond the label and using creative ways to leverage the healthy claim.

> So as mentioned in the presentation, we have been working on developing a healthy symbol. The symbol would be a standardized graphic, and I showed some examples on the slide that manufacturers could use to show that their products meet the healthy criteria. And so it can really be sort of as that quick visual.

> We have conducted two rounds of focus groups and also an experimental study of-- related to a healthy symbol, to really learn what would be the most useful for consumers. And we don't have a specific timeline to share at this point, but again, we are continuing to work on the healthy symbol work.

> Robin McKinnon, FDA [00:49:10]

> Maybe I can just add on there, Sarah, as well. We know that, because I was involved in some of the early work on the healthy symbol, and we found that people-- they were hesitant to engage, especially manufacturers, on the symbol until they had seen the updated criteria. 
> 
> So now it's kind of a natural progression, if you like, to have finalized the updated criteria and then to be turning a focus to the-- towards the symbol.
