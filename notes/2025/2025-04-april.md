## HHS official on background about restructuring of department

> Last Thursday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced a dramatic restructuring in accordance with President Trump's Executive Order, “Implementing the President’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Workforce Optimization Initiative.” This overhaul is about realigning HHS with its core mission: to stop the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again. Despite spending $1.9 trillion in annual costs, Americans are getting sicker every year, and we must shift course.
> 
> The reorganization is being done in phases. The first phase was last week’s announcement to inform American taxpayers how HHS will produce better health outcomes for them and their families. The second phase rolled out Tuesday, was to notify roughly 10,000 employees who were impacted as part of the reduction in force. HHS leaders focused personnel cuts on redundant or unnecessary administrative positions.
> 
> Here are some of the best examples: 
>  
> • Despite only having 28 divisions, HHS had 41 Chief Information Officers. 
> 
> • There were 1,400 external affairs officers. 
> 
> • HHS had 100 communications offices. 
> 
> • HHS had 40 procurement departments. 
> 
> • There were dozens of IT departments. 
> 
> • There were dozens of HR departments. 
> 
> • There were more than 8 Senior Finance Officials. 
> 
> HHS also reduced its regional footprint by moving out of the highest cost cities, shuttering offices in Boston, Chicago, NYC, San Francisco, and Seattle. The reorganization from 28 to 15 divisions is necessary, but critical programs amongst these divisions will continue under the new operational structure.
> 
> The Department is now detailing the structure of each redefined division to streamline operations, enhance responsiveness to the American people, and ultimately improve the nation’s health as part of the Make America Healthy Again initiative.
> 
> HHS will notify external stakeholders, including Congress and will comply with all statutory requirements.

> The Indian Health Service (IHS) has long faced challenges related to staffing shortages. Secretary Kennedy remains committed to prioritizing tribal health and the IHS, as reflected in his statements at the recent STAC meeting. Importantly, IHS was not impacted by the recent workforce reductions, and there are no plans to consolidate any of its offices.
> 
> To address staffing needs and support the IHS in fulfilling its mission, HHS has invited certain individuals to consider positions within the IHS. These invitations are voluntary, and individuals have the option to accept or decline. Secretary Kennedy and the Department remain steadfast in their commitment to ensuring that American Indian and Alaska Native communities receive timely, quality healthcare.

## NIH director Dr Jay Bhattacharya in email to institute staff

- **Source:** email

- **Date:** received April 1, 2025

> Dear Colleagues:
>  
> As I begin my tenure as the 18th Director of the National Institutes of Health, I want to first express my appreciation for all of you — the NIH scientists and staff whose work has contributed to lifesaving breakthroughs in biology and medicine. I most recently worked at Stanford University where my research in health economics was made possible with NIH support. I am honored and humbled to lead this agency and join you in service of the American people.
>  
> As a doctor, economist, and (now former) professor at Stanford University, I have always been driven by a passion for improving public health and fostering an environment where scientific inquiry can flourish. Throughout my career, I have been supported by NIH, an institution that I love.
>  
> NIH's mission to enhance health remains vital as millions of children and adults in this country face poor outcomes due to chronic diseases like obesity, heart disease, and cancer. We must build on the agency’s track record of tackling complex challenges and recommit to our mission to addressing the chronic disease crisis. While basic research will continue to lay the groundwork for future discoveries, we will invest in innovative, cutting-edge research that has the power to transform health. Importantly, our discoveries will only make an impact if the public has confidence in our findings and trusts that we are working in their best interests.
>  
> To help us achieve these goals, I have established the following five top priorities:
> 
> Focus on Improving Population Health: The work of NIH, whether basic or applied, must address the health needs of the American people, including the chronic disease crises that have hampered the well-being of countless Americans.
> Reproducibility and Rigor: The research NIH conducts and supports must be rigorous, reproducible, and unbiased. NIH must address and solve the reproducibility crisis in the biomedical sciences.
> 
> Innovation and Collaboration: NIH must be at the forefront of biomedical innovation. This will involve embracing new technologies, new ideas, and new approaches to old problems.
> 
> Research Safety and Transparency: NIH must ensure that all the experiments we support pose no risk of harm to human populations and meet the highest ethical standards. We must maintain the highest standards of transparency in all our endeavors.
> 
> Academic Freedom: Advances in science require the freedom to think differently from the scientific consensus. I will foster an environment where varied perspectives are valued and encouraged at NIH and the broader scientific community.
> 
> I recognize that I am joining NIH at a time of tremendous change. Every inch of the federal government is under scrutiny—and NIH is not exempt. As a result of the Department of Health and Human Services’ streamlining effort and upcoming reorganization, NIH experienced a significant reduction in its workforce. Many of our valued colleagues are losing their jobs, which is in no way a reflection of the quality of their work. I want to express my deepest gratitude to those who will be affected for all you have contributed to the mission of NIH. These reductions in the workforce will have a profound impact on key NIH administrative functions, including communications, legislative affairs, procurement, and human resources, and will require an entirely new approach to how we carry them out. As we navigate these challenges, I will do my best to lead NIH through these reforms, implement new policies humanely, and endeavor to earn your trust.
>  
> I know we all agree that it is a privilege for us to do science to improve the health of all Americans. Thank you for your efforts and dedication to the great mission of NIH.
>  
> All the best,
>  
> Jay Bhattacharya, M.D., Ph.D.
> NIH Director
