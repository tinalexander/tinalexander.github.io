> David Sugerman, CDC [17:00:32]
> 
> Following the COVID 19 pandemic, we've had a measles resurgence due to increased measles transmission abroad, a surge in international travel and declines in measles vaccination, especially in close knit communities with already low vaccine coverage.
> 
> ...
> 
> David Sugerman, CDC [17:01:02]
> 
> While the number of outbreaks fluctuated from 4 to 16 over this period, the proportion of total cases that are outbreak associated increase from half to 93% this year with five outbreaks, ongoing.
> 
> We will be tracking duration, working closely with our state and local partners to ensure we don't cross the 12 month threshold and preserve our elimination status with ongoing spring and summer travel and congregate events. 
> 
> This map shows measles cases by state from light to dark blue. Half of our states are reporting measles cases. Most states are reporting no or limited further spread from importations.
> 
> Of note, there are also large measles outbreaks in the same close-knit community to our north in Ontario, Canada bordering Minnesota through New York, and to the south in Chihuahua, Mexico, bordering Texas, and New Mexico.
> 
> ...
> 
> David Sugerman, CDC [17:02:07]
> 
> Over 90% of the current national cases are related to the Southwest outbreak driven by transmission in close-knit under vaccinated communities with low vaccine coverage. 
> 
> The non Southwest cases are largely importations with some degree of spread from all WHO regions, largely from Canada and Vietnam. 
> 
> ...
> 
> David Sugerman, CDC [17:04:34]
> 
> Most of the sequences thus far are genotype D8, DSId 9171, which is present in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Kansas. 
> 
> This same sequence has also been identified in the ongoing outbreaks in Chihuahua, Mexico in Ontario, Canada among the same close-knit under vaccinated community.
> 
> ...
> 
> David Sugerman, CDC [17:05:19]
> 
> At the invitation of Texas Department of State Health Services, we deployed 15 from CDC, including two from NIOSH through an Epi-Aid to provide onsite technical assistance to Texas during March 4th to April 1st, with another team of seven deploying today.
> 
> On the ground, we've provided infection prevention control assistance to seven healthcare facilities with ventilation assessments and proposed solutions, reviewed school infection control activities and risk mitigation strategies, developed an internal dashboard for Texas to track cases by location and exposure location, and supported measles prevention communication. 
> 
> Our team at headquarters continues to provide remote technical assistance to multiple state health departments, to include laboratory diagnostics and genomic sequencing of the virus, guidance on post exposure prophylaxis, healthcare infection prevention, case investigation, and confirmation and communication support. 
> 
> We're holding biweekly national measles calls with public health partners to provide a forum for CDC and health departments to share information regarding the measles outbreak and biweekly trilateral calls with Canada and Mexico to share updates and best practices. 
> 
> CDC's immunization services division continues to make additional outbreak related MMR vaccine doses available for health departments to order at their request.
> 
> ...
> 
> David Sugerman, CDC [17:07:01]
> 
> We're supporting several laboratory activities, including coordination with the Association for Public Health Laboratories, vaccine preventable disease reference centers for genotyping and sequencing. 
> 
> We're helping standardize and expand testing through wastewater surveillance for measles with the National Wastewater Surveillance system and center of excellence in Texas with multiple sites in Texas and New Mexico.
> 
> And CDC's Center for Forecasting Outbreak Analytics is providing ongoing modeling support to determine risk to the general population and close-knit communities. 
> 
> ...
> 
> David Sugerman, CDC [17:08:41]
> 
> We do believe that there's quite a large amount of cases that are not reported and under reported in working very closely with our colleagues in Texas.
> 
> In talking with families, they may mention prior cases that have recovered and never received testing, other families that may have cases and never had sought treatment. 
> 
> So we do think that there is under testing, and therefore under diagnosis and under reporting, which leads to a smaller denominator than likely is there in this.
> 
> And it's not uncommon in close knit communities that may also have lower healthcare seeking behavior at baseline as well.
> 
> ...
> 
> David Sugerman, CDC [17:11:12]
> 
> So there are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas. There are funding limitations in light of COVID 19 funding dissipating, and they are mobilizing the resources they have and moving staff from other domains into measles, moving them from other regions into region one in particular, to help support the response, though they're also seeing cases in outside of region one, and need to stay ready. 
> 
> We are attempting to support and impart the field staff that are deploying or to augment the staff on the ground. But there are additional financial and personnel resources that we are hearing from Texas, in addition from other jurisdictions. 
> 
> So we we're trying to support where we can. But I'm assuming if this is going to be ongoing, that those will be significant financial resources needed.
> 
> The estimates are that each measles case can be 30 to 50,000 dollars for public health response work. And that adds up quite quickly. 
> 
> So I don't know if others have more to share, but I think that we are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions.
> 
> ...
> 
> David Sugerman, CDC [17:13:27]
> 
> We're four months in, so this would be the end of January of the following year. 
> 
> About 20th-- around the 20th of January, of next year.
> 
> ...
> 
> David Sugerman, CDC [17:14:08]
> 
> We have not had reports of still births or miscarriages. 
> 
> We have tracked measles cases in pregnant women, including a case of congenital measles, who recovered. But it is, as you mentioned, a significant risk in pregnant women that can develop measles and go on to have pre-term labor, complicated deliveries, and then infants that that can have negative outcomes. 
> 
> It also leads to complicated exposures in hospitals that we've already also seen, at one of the facilities in Texas and could be others as pregnant women come in and may not necessarily have a rash, may have minimal symptoms that then progress to additional symptoms and are not necessarily in negative pressure and then require that. 
> 
> So that's another substantial cause of, of morbidity with spread, from pregnant women that may present with symptoms.

## CDC statement on increase in autism prevalence data 

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** Karyl Rattay, MD, MS, FAAP, director of CDC’s Division of Human Development and Disability
- **Date:** received April 15, 2025

> New autism data released today shows that approximately 1 in 31 (3.2%) 8-year-old children in CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network were identified with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Prevalence varied widely across the 16 ADDM sites – from 1 in 103 in Texas (Laredo) to 1 in 19 in California – which could reflect differences in availability of services for early detection, evaluation, and diagnostic practices in each community. 
> 
> The ADDM report is an example of data for action. Healthcare providers, educators, and community leaders can use the data to advance initiatives, systems, and research to ensure that every child has access to timely evaluation and support.   
> 
> CDC will continue working with partners to improve early identification and increase recognition of the need for supports for individuals with ASD and their families.

> Jamie Loehr, ACIP [09:35:09]
> 
> So here it's fairly clear that you're saying the cost effectiveness is uncertain, but on the following slide, you're saying that the resource use is probably yes. Did you have any kind of cost effectiveness analysis? Did you have any kind of evaluation of number of patients? I'm not seeing anything here than the way that I normally would expect a presentation to talk to me about resource use?
> 
> Faisal Minhaj, CDC [09:35:39]
> 
> No, unfortunately we didn't have any data looking up the cost effectiveness of vaccination in this adolescent population. This population is likely a small group of adolescents that would require this, but this was not something that was conducted.
> 
> Jamie Loehr, ACIP [09:35:53]
> 
> So then my comment is that I'm very hesitant to make a recommendation without any sense of resource use. 
> 
> So if we have, the slide nine, there are about 150 adolescents who had a case of mpox during the outbreak, but we've had 10 cases in the last two years.
> 
> If we're making this a recommendation for people at risk, I don't even know how many people are at risk.
> 
> For adults, men who have sex with men is about 3% a year. That would be if we took that number several hundred thousand people possibly at risk, it's probably much lower for teenagers. 
> 
> And so we're talking about vaccinating tens to hundreds of thousands of people for 10 cases? 
> 
> I also don't know the price of the vaccine. I had to look that up. There's about 200 to $300 of dose. And so this seems like an extraordinary expenditure of resources for a very small number of cases. And I don't even have the information in front of me. 
> 
> So it's often a question of, from the work group to the ACIP, what information would you like before you're making a vote? And I'm very clear that I would like much more information about resource use.
> 
> ...
> 
> Tracy Beth Hoeg, FDA [09:41:52]
> 
> I just want to point out, from epidemiological standpoint, from the risk benefit ratio with this proposed recommendation, number two, that as so many people are pointing out this age group is at very, very low risk of even having a monkeypox case? It looks like we had less than 20 in the last year. 
> 
> And when you consider the amount of safety data we have, from the small number of people that have received the vaccine so far in this age group, and then this 315 adolescents in the clinical trial, it's very challenging, I think to say that we know that the benefits of this vaccine would outweigh the potential harms because we just have such a small denominator in terms of number of adolescents who have been vaccinated so far. 
> 
> And I want to point out Dr. Creech's presentation, he mentioned that they excluded adolescents with underlying significant heart conditions and significant medical conditions. So I also think that's important for providers to keep in mind that they were excluded from the trial. 
> 
> So we don't really know about the safety in those adolescents. 
> 
> Thanks, I'll leave my comment at that.
> 
> Keipp Talbot, ACIP [09:43:06]
> 
> Thank you. And Dr. Rao, did you want to make a response?
> 
> Agam Rao, CDC [09:43:11]
> 
> I was just going to say that we just-- we also did not have a cost effectiveness analysis when this was done for adults. 
> 
> The purpose being that this entire vote was-- the plan was for it to be revisited in a few years. 
> 
> And so the thought was, we know that this is happening right now. We can do a cost effective analysis down the road. 
> 
> And then also just to point out, it's true that there are fewer cases occurring right now, but the morbidity, the mortality, all of that is pretty significant. And it was intended just to be an extension of the age, to the lower population. 
> 
> So, if we had had this data, when the adult vote was considered, then the vote would've been for this population as well. 
> 
> The risk is no different was our thought process. 
> 
> ...
>
> Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, CDC [12:39:18]
> 
> As a reminder, in October 2024, ACIP voted to recommend an additional dose of 2024, 25. COVID 19 vaccine for adults ages 65 years and older. And for everyone ages six months and older with moderate and severe immunocompromise.
> 
> People who are immunocompromised are also eligible for additional doses under shared clinical decision making. The April 2025 meeting agenda is listed and no votes are scheduled. 
> 
> And the proposed schedule for June 2025 includes votes on the 2025-26 COVID 19 recommendations, including additional dose recommendations for eligible groups.
>
> ...
> 
> Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, CDC [12:41:47]
> 
> One important consideration is whether to maintain the current multi-dose initial series for people ages six months to four years. And people with immunocompromised. 
> 
> Another consideration is whether to maintain the universal recommendation for everyone ages six months and older or move to a risk based recommendation. 
> 
> A third option is a combination of a risk based and universal vaccine recommendation. An example of this is a risk based recommendation for people ages six months to 64 years, and a universal recommendation for people ages 65 years and older. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, CDC [12:42:59]
> 
> If a risk based recommendation is to be considered for 2025, 26, defining who's at risk could be complex. How much increased risk is sufficient for recommendation?
> 
> There are certain groups that increased risk of severe outcomes based on age, underlying conditions and pregnancy status and groups at increased risk of exposure, including healthcare workers and people living in long term care facilities and other congregate settings. 
> 
> The CDC's current list of conditions that conclusively increase the risk of severe COVID 19 is extensive and predominantly based on pre-Omicron data. The list of conditions brings up the question, how much of the population has one of these conditions.
> 
> An analysis of U.S. adults with conditions that put them at higher risk of severe illness due to COVID 19 was carried out using medical claims data, consumer data, the behavioral risk factor surveillance system, and the national health interview survey to enumerate the U.S. population with conditions that put them at increased risk of severe illness from COVID 19 using multi-level regression modeling.
> 
> Notably the conditions highlighted by the red boxes were not included in the analysis. The analysis showed that the population of U.S. adults with at least one condition that puts them at higher risk of severe illness from COVID 19 generally increases with age. Approximately 74% of all U.S. adults, 18 and older had at least one condition. And as a reminder, this analysis did not include people with Parkinson's disease, physical inactivity, and steroid use, or other immunosuppressive medications, which is expected to lead to a larger percentages across all age groups. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, CDC [12:55:26]
> 
> The work group raised concerns about moving to a risk based only vaccine recommendation and how this would impact COVID 19 vaccination coverage among people with high risk conditions, because influenza vaccine was initially recommended for people with high risk conditions and moved to a universal recommendation in 2010, it was used as an example of what could potentially happen to coverage among people with high risk conditions, if COVID 19 vaccine recommendations were to be risk based. 
> 
> For influenza vaccine coverage among 18 to 49 year olds with high risk conditions increased approximately two percentage points between 2008 to 2009 and 2010 to 2011, but plateaued thereafter, no significant changes were seen among people with high risk conditions when vaccine recommendations targeted people with high risk conditions only compared to a universal vaccine policy.
> 
> ...
> 
> Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, CDC [13:01:52]
> 
> Based on the information presented to the work group as of February 13th, 2025, which included data on risk factors for hospitalization, trends in mortality, risk-based versus universal vaccine coverage, vaccine hesitancy, and COVID 19 and myocarditis, the majority of the work group supported a risk-based recommendation for 25-26 COVID 19 vaccination.
> 
> Among work group members who selected a non universal policy recommendation, almost all supported a risk based recommendation by conditions and exposures, a universal recommendation for certain age groups, as well as permissive language to allow anyone who wanted protection from COVID 19 vaccine to get a vaccine.
> 
> Following this poll, additional data on vaccine effectiveness, seroprevalence, long COVID vaccine coverage, and MIS-C were presented to the work group and the work group also received feedback on the recommendations from liaison organizations.
> 
> Between March and April 2025, the AAFP, AAP, AIM, ACP, APHA and ACOG provided feedback on moving to a potential risk based COVID 19 vaccine recommendation. Concerns were raised regarding implementation, communication, confidence in the recommendation and equitable access to vaccination with the potential risk based recommendation. 
> 
> The work group was re-polled on April 3rd and the majority of the work group still supported a risk based recommendation for 2025-2026 COVID 19 vaccination.
> 
> Among work group members who selected a non universal policy recommendation for everyone, on April 3rd, almost all supported a risk based recommendation by condition or exposure, a universal recommendation for some age groups, as well as permissive language to allow anyone wanting protection from COVID 19 vaccination to receive one.
> 
> ...
> 
> Denise Jamieson, ACIP [13:06:11]
> 
> I guess with the very high proportion of adults with risk factors that you mentioned, 74%, and COVID, although it's dropped is still a leading cause of death among both adults and children, I guess I'm surprised we're considering a risk based recommendation, which in general, we have not had a lot of success with implementing in the U.S. 
> 
> The other thing is you mentioned hepatitis B as an example where universal recommendation did not increase, but to me it's not really a relevant comparison. A relevant comparison is flu, and to decouple flu and COVID, you know, people are just starting to understand the importance of getting their COVID and flu vaccine every year. I worry about implementation. 
> 
> I also worry about the feasibility of a permissive recommendation given healthcare financing. It may be very difficult for people to find a way to get the vaccine paid for if it's permissive. 
> 
> So I would, at this point, with the information presented, I would be in favor of a universal rather than a risk based recommendation. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Jamie Loehr, ACIP [13:07:40]
> 
> I'm very happy that we're seriously considering a risk based recommendation. I'm glad that we're taking this as a reasonable possibility. 
> 
> If you could go to surround slide 14, this is the most of the population considered at risk. You had the 18 to 50 year olds in the 60% range for the people at risk. And this just does not compute with my experience with 18 to 50 year olds. 
> 
> If you go back one slide here, I don't have 60 plus percent of 18 to 50 year olds with any of these diagnoses. And so that just seems incredibly high. I could buy maybe 50 year olds, definitely the elderly, but I don't think that's accurate or probably ages five through 50. 
> 
> I also, even though I'm very much in favor of considering a risk base, I am concerned about the feasibility of it and the message it might be sending. 
> 
> COVID is still a fairly dangerous disease and very, very common. We're not talking about 10 cases of mpox. We're talking about thousands of hospitalizations and deaths. And so even though I'm in favor of a risk base, I still have my hesitations. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Edwin Jose Asturias, ACIP [13:09:24]
> 
> I think given that I'm very much concentrating in the young infants and children who I think we have not taken care as we should for, so to protect them against COVID, data on the current transfer of maternal antibody will be useful. 
> 
> I think most of the data that we have comes from the previous years, where basically we were trying to understand that that was offering of protection, but if there was any possibility of getting current data, given that most women now have been either infected or vaccinated will be interesting. 
> 
> And then a more granular data on the hospitalization of children in the first year of life, especially, why are these kids getting hospitalized? I think some of our data from influenza shows that they get hospitalized mainly for fever and irritability, and they, even though some of them end up in the ICU, it will be interesting to sort of see what the causes of hospitalizations are.
> 
> ...
> 
> Oliver Brooks, ACIP [13:10:50]
> 
> What I would want to see is modeling around long COVID. I mean, it was shown that there's about a 3% prevalence incidence of 8%. The slide where you were asking for questions. So like the very, I want to say the last slide. 
> 
> And even though let's say to rate of COVID among, let's say a healthy 30 year old is low. If they have the potential to get long COVID, which again was lower numbers, but still the absolute numbers may be high versus the percentages, I am concerned about them. 
> 
> My primary concern through all of this at this point now is still long COVID. So what I would like to see is some modeling regarding the absolute numbers of long COVID related to the lower age groups may not receive a recommendation to get vaccinated.
> 
> ...
> 
> Noel Brewer, ACIP [13:12:13]
> 
> There's not clear evidence at all that risk based approaches are less effective. It's certainly something we've all talked about and something that some of the companies have shared for many years, but the data supporting that claim are not really there. 
> 
> And so I used to believe that risk based approaches were problematic, but based on the data that I saw, I don't know that I can support that, that conclusion may be true for my best guess, but it's not an evidence based conclusion.
> 
> ...
> 
> Charlotte Moser, ACIP [13:12:53]
> 
> I am supportive of the risk based idea. I'm glad we're exploring that. 
> 
> I do think when we think about which groups and age was mentioned, that we should, I agree with Dr. Asturias, make sure that we're keeping the youngest of children on our radar, because they represent a new group of large susceptible or a new large group of susceptibles to this virus every year. 
> 
> And if we can vaccinate those kids, we may decrease that under one year old hospitalization rate, and we may also protect them against long COVID on their first exposure to the virus, albeit those data aren't as strong. 
> 
> And I think it's that vaccinating those kids in the younger time period also gets us away from the concerns that we had about vaccinating adolescents around myocarditis. So those are my comments on this slide.
> 
> ...
> 
> Charlotte Moser, ACIP [13:14:28]
> 
> I was wondering if, while we're talking about COVID, maybe our FDA liaison would be able to offer an update for the members of the listening public questions about what's happening with Novavax?
> 
> Tracy Beth Hoeg, FDA [13:14:42]
> 
> Yes, that is a good question. I actually-- I don't know to what extent I'm allowed to give an update on that, but we should-- there will be an update coming out publicly very soon.
> 
> ...
> 
> Sandra Fryhofer, AMA [13:15:22]
> 
> I see patients in the office every day. I'm an internal medicine physician. So a lot of my patients are older and fragile, as a new grandmother, I also worry about the very young, and I go back to that slide that you showed that 74% of patients have at least one risk factor. And then I go, what it's-- I go to what it's like to be in practice? 
> 
> And, you might have heard the expression, KISS, keep it simple. I'll let you figure out what you want the second S to be. 
> 
> But, the reality is most of these vaccines, certainly for adults are being given in pharmacies. The risk based recommendations are more difficult for pharmacists because patients have to self declare their illnesses or the pharmacists have to check their medication list. And that's-- patients may not feel comfortable with that. 
> 
> So I am on the COVID vaccine work group, and I was one of the 19% that did recommend-- that did suggest a universal recommendation. And, that is why.
> 
> ...
> 
> Jamie Loehr, ACIP [13:16:26]
> 
> I'd like to comment on Dr. Brewer's comment. In the pneumococcal work group, we've been showing data that it's pretty clear that the risk based recommendation for 50 to 65 was actually only about 20% of uptake. 
> 
> Whereas the age based recommendation for 65 and over was about 65% uptake. 
> 
> So for me, that does suggest that a risk based recommendation actually does not have as much uptake as a universal recommendation or age based. It still doesn't mean that I don't agree with the risk based, but I did want to at least put that comment out there.

> 
> When I was in medical school, there was no nutrition class. I actually ran for student body president and won on that campaign promise and we started one.
> 
> Today in America, most medical schools do not teach nutrition. Why does that matter? Because if you go to four years of medical school and bust your tail and learn everything and nutrition, wasn't on the docket, what does that message to you? It doesn't matter. It's not important. 
> 
> If it was critical, you would've been taught it because you learned everything else you needed to learn in medical school. If nutrition's not on the agenda, not in the syllabus, it's not really important for you. And I believe that we should empower folks and these executive orders will do just that to be able to navigate nutrition. 
> 
> And we have plans that CMS to make that easier.

> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [01:01:27]
> 
> We're in a crisis today. We're about to announce new autism numbers. 
> 
> They've, again, gone up dramatically just in two years. We have in some states as low as 1 out of 20 boys having autism, and 1 out of 31 kids. 
> 
> And when I was in my generation today, the rate of autism is one in 10,000. 
> 
> And this is just one disease. This whole generation of kids is damaged by chronic disease. 
> 
> I was talking to the governor that I walked through an airport and I see these young people, who once again have hope because of what's happening in this administration, but you can see the chronic inflammation, you can see the mitochondrial challenges that they're facing. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [01:15:10]
> 
> I would say that CDC in this case has done a very good job at controlling the measles outbreak.
> 
> We've had about, under 700 cases nationally. And in Europe they've had 127,000 cases, 37 deaths. 
> 
> The -- there -- people get measles because they don't vaccinate. They get measles because the vaccine wanes.
> 
> The vaccines wane about 4.8% per year. And so-- that-- it's a leaky vaccine and that problem is always gonna be around. 
> 
> We need to also make sure that doctors know how to treat measles and how to treat the associated disease, the pulmonary diseases that often come with them, and bacteriological. 
> 
> And we can't rely simply on the vaccine. We also have to know how to treat measles. 
> 
> Children shouldn't die of measles. When I was a kid, before the measles vaccine was introduced, there was half a million people who got measles, as many as 2 million a year, and nobody got in the newspapers for them, for that. 
> 
> But the death rate was about 400 people a year, mainly children who were malnourished, the children. 
> 
> So it was a infection fatality rate of 1 in 1,200 to 1 in 10,000 children, healthy children should not die of measles. 
> 
> And there's no reason they should, if the doctors know how to treat at the hospital, that will not happen.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [01:18:04]
> 
> It's outrageous that we don't have as surveillance system that functions.
> 
> CDC did a study on its own, the only surveillance system, it has VAERS really. 
> 
> And, CDC did a study on it in 2010 and fewer than one-- it captures fewer than 1% of vaccine injuries. So that's CDC's own study.
> 
> And they had it on the-- they had, at that time, a machine counting system that they were gonna roll out to all the HMOs and they put it on a shelf and we are going to roll that out, exactly the system that you're talking about, we're going to do, we're going to improve the surveillance, we're going to get the data sets from everybody. We going to do data sharing agreements with scientists all over the world, with the best scientists. 
> 
> And we're going to find out what contribution vaccines and everything else, mold, EMF, food, all of these other exposures began in the late 1980s, which one of those are the culprits. 
> 
> I suspect we're going to see that there's a lot of culprits, but we need to know.
>

> We are launching requests for scientists from all over the country and all over the world to start to directly answer that question. Nothing like that has ever been done before. It should have been done 20 years ago. 
> 
> You know, when I was a kid, the autism rates were about 1 in 10,000, to 2 in 10,000 today. Today they are 1 in 36 officially, but the new ADDM reports are going to come out the next week. And the preliminary numbers look like it's dropped when extraordinary, astonishing, 1 in every 31 kids with some communities being very, very badly hurt. 
> 
> Black boys it's down to, I think about it looks like about 1 in 12 or 1 in 10. So this is an epidemic like nothing we've ever seen before. It dwarves the COVID epidemic. The cause to our country-- these are children, COVID was killing elderly people at the end of their lives. This is disabling children of their entire lives.
> 
> Question [03:51:36]
> 
> So there for a long time there was thought that vaccines might be related to this. Then they did several studies that said that there was no connection between vaccines and autism. So what are you seeing in this data that you're looking at or is it all going to be brand new?
> 
> Secretary Kennedy [03:51:54]
> 
> The studies that they did were very, very narrow and there were about 17 studies. The Institute of Medicine, which is part of the National Academy of Sciences, says that 14 of those studies are invalid. And the biggest weakness in those studies is they never studied vaccinated versus unvaccinated group, which is the only way that you can really make this determination. 
> 
> And more importantly, none of the vaccines that are given to children during the first six months of life were ever studied. We're going to look at vaccines, but we're going to look at everything. Everything is on the table, our food system, our water, our air, different ways of parenting. All the kind of changes that may have triggered this epidemic. 
> 
> It is an epidemic. Epidemics are not caused by genes. Genes can provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin. So we know that it is an environmental toxin that is causing this cataclysm and we are going to identify it. 
> 
> We are narrowly focused on identifying it and using as many scientists as we can from universities and research centers all over the world, focus them through NIH, through Jay Bhattacharya to focus them on answering this question.

> Fluoride should not be in our water. 
> 
> Fluoride had a strong justification in the 1940s, when it was added, and people didn't understand the science and they thought its benefit to our teeth was systemic. 
> 
> And by drinking it, it would enter your body and somehow protect their teeth. 
> 
> Now we know that there is no systemic advantage, zero systemic advantage, and that the only advantage comes from topical application. 
> 
> So it's the water that passes it through your mouth. You can achieve that benefit from brushing your teeth and in the era of fluoridated toothpastes and mouth washes, it makes no sense to have fluoride in our water. 
> 
> The evidence against fluoride is overwhelming.
> 
> In animals, in animal models and in human models, we know that it causes IQ loss, profound IQ loss, and it's dose related. 
> 
> So if the more fluoride you get the higher levels in your drinking water, your urine, the more likely it is you lose IQ. And also other neurological injuries like ADHD. 
> 
> It affects-- there's science that indicates that it affects kidney health, that it affects liver health, that it causes hyperthyroidism, that it causes osteoarthritis.

> Women who are more exposed have up to 50% more hip fractures and than women who are unexposed.

> It causes fluoridasis in between 40 and 80% of our kids.

> It evolved when I read the science.
> 
> I think I read it most carefully in the last couple of years and the science evolved. 
> 
> The national toxicity program issued its report in August. And that report was devastating. 
> 
> And, I don't think-- I think we need to apply the precautionary principle in this country that we should do no harm. And it clearly is doing harm.
> 
> I mean, the trade off is IQ loss in kids and what-- we can't afford that in this country, we need all the brain power that we can to handle the challenges of the future. 
> 
> And then the other health impacts which are less clearly documented in the science, because they have not been completely well studied, but they are alarming enough that we shouldn't be demanding that parents accept something for their children and in their homes, that is essentially a medication.
> 
> So they can go to the drugstore and they can get toothpaste. They can, if you want to apply it in your home, you can, you can get mouthwash. 
> 
> And I believe, and I think it's a moral imperative that we all believe, in freedom of choice in this country. It is one of the bedrock principles of our democracy that the government shouldn't be making decisions, intimate decisions, about our own lives. 
> 
> And then, just the science is overwhelming on it now. It doesn't make any sense.

## Email to Vet-LIRN laboratories about FDA's RIF

- **Source:** email

- **Date:** received April 3, 2025

```
Dear Network Laboratories,
Unfortunately, significant Reductions In Force (RIF), including a key
quality assurance officer, at FDA's Human Food Program Moffett Center
has caused immediate and significant impact on the Veterinary
Laboratory Investigation and Response Network (Vet-LIRN) Proficiency
Exercise Program. The RIF affected nearly all FDA staff at Moffett,
including the scientific staff that develop and issue the proficiency test
(PT) samples, analyze data, and create reports. The Moffett Center is an
ISO accredited PT provider that supports the PT needs of Vet-LIRN, the
Food Emergency Response Network (FERN), as well as FDA Grade A
Milk and Shellfish programs, and others.
We regret to inform you that the Interlaboratory Comparison Exercise for
detecting Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in milk (HPAI ICE-1), set to
ship later this month, is suspended.
The HPAI ICE-1, which included over 40 registered labs across the Vet-
LIRN and NAHLN networks, as well as FDA food labs and private
industry, would have been critical to ensure confidence in the laboratory
methods for food safety and animal health. We are still assessing the full
extent of the impact and will send Vet-LIRN wide messaging on this
exercise in the near future.
Additionally, we regret to share that Vet-LIRN's Proficiency Exercise
Program is suspended for at least the remainder of FY25. Since 2010,
we have conducted 40 proficiency exercises, ensuring laboratory
preparedness for major animal food safety issues, including the detection
of Salmonella and Aflatoxin in pet food. The program also supported the
implementation of new methods and technologies and was instrumental
during the COVID-19 pandemic to maintain confidence in testing for
humans and animals.
We are disappointed to share this news but wanted to keep you informed.
Thank you for your continued dedication and contribution to the Vet-LIRN
program. We will provide more updates as they are available.
Thank you,
Vet-LIRN Program Office
```

> You already know Jim Traficant is our new chief of staff-- now it gets fun, because I get a point to you, and you have to stand up and wave. No, I'm just kidding. It's killing me to stay on script, but I'm doing it right. I'm doing it. 
> 
> Okay, Jim Traficant, our new chief of staff and I hope you've had the chance to read a little bit of his bio that went out in the all hands. Suffice it to say, Jim has had extensive executive and operational leadership experience supporting federal state commercial and international healthcare organizations. 
> 
> Importantly, he also happens to have a long friendship with Dr Makary and will be able to help effectively translate and advance his priorities here at FDA. 
> 
> You also likely read a little bit about-- thank you, very good, welcome Jim. 
> 
> You've also likely read about our new acting head of the FDA's human foods program, Kyle Diamantas-- there he is-- who has experience in the food sector and is well versed in the federal food drug and cosmetic act, as well as FDA's operational framework. 
> 
> He has extensive experience working with federal and state agencies, scientific organizations, consumer advocacy groups, and industry stakeholders. He also has a wide ranging experience spanning regulatory compliance, investigation enforcement and rule making. 
> 
> The third person I want to acknowledge today is Grace Graham. Where is Grace? Other side, okay. To keep people on their toes and the cameras are swiveling. No. So Grace is with our office of policy legislation and international affairs. Grace has a distinguished history in healthcare and legislative affairs, having served in a variety of positions in both houses of Congress. Most recently as chief health counsel in the house. And before that, as health policy director of the Senate health education, labor and pensions committee, she's also very familiar with the FDA's work, having served as a policy advisor in the Senate on FDA matters. Grace already started working in OPLIA. And so we look forward to her continued leadership. 
> 
> Most of you probably saw the all hands that went out last week, announcing another of our new members, our new deputy commissioner for operations and our chief operating officer, Dr. Barclay Butler. Barclay has more than 40 years of experience leading organizations through significant transformational change in both the public and private sectors. In addition to working in the private sector, he spent nearly a decade with the defense health agency. Most recently as assistant director for support.

> They need the FDA's scientists to ensure public safety, examine root causes of other medical problems that are unforeseen, using the disciplines of toxicology, environmental health, food safety, and basic scientific methodology, you are in a unique position to address many of these problems one small piece at a time.
> 
> Our generation's new chronic disease epidemic also means that we need novel therapies, cures, and meaningful treatments. It also means that we need new approaches. We need fresh new ideas.
> 
> To do this, we have to listen to one another, a lesson that applies in my opinion, to our broader polarized society. We need to recognize nuance, promote civil discourse. In fact, science has always been based on debating and discussing different ideas, different opinions in the scientific sphere among experts are good.

> Allowing experts to debate new approaches to old problems is exactly what we need right now. Our country is sick. Obesity is not a willpower problem. Food deserts are not a genetic issue. 
> 
> To address the biggest health needs of this country, we need new ideas and fresh new perspectives. We need open-mindedness and a willingness to challenge deeply held assumptions just as scientists did in challenging opioids were not addictive. That sugar is healthy.

- **Date:** received April 2, 2025

> Last Thursday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced a dramatic restructuring in accordance with President Trump's Executive Order, “Implementing the President’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Workforce Optimization Initiative.” This overhaul is about realigning HHS with its core mission: to stop the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again. Despite spending $1.9 trillion in annual costs, Americans are getting sicker every year, and we must shift course.
> 
> The reorganization is being done in phases. The first phase was last week’s announcement to inform American taxpayers how HHS will produce better health outcomes for them and their families. The second phase rolled out Tuesday, was to notify roughly 10,000 employees who were impacted as part of the reduction in force. HHS leaders focused personnel cuts on redundant or unnecessary administrative positions.
> 
> Here are some of the best examples: 
>  
> • Despite only having 28 divisions, HHS had 41 Chief Information Officers. 
> 
> • There were 1,400 external affairs officers. 
> 
> • HHS had 100 communications offices. 
> 
> • HHS had 40 procurement departments. 
> 
> • There were dozens of IT departments. 
> 
> • There were dozens of HR departments. 
> 
> • There were more than 8 Senior Finance Officials. 
> 
> HHS also reduced its regional footprint by moving out of the highest cost cities, shuttering offices in Boston, Chicago, NYC, San Francisco, and Seattle. The reorganization from 28 to 15 divisions is necessary, but critical programs amongst these divisions will continue under the new operational structure.
> 
> The Department is now detailing the structure of each redefined division to streamline operations, enhance responsiveness to the American people, and ultimately improve the nation’s health as part of the Make America Healthy Again initiative.
> 
> HHS will notify external stakeholders, including Congress and will comply with all statutory requirements.

## NIH director Dr Jay Bhattacharya in email to institute staff

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** obtained by CBS News
- **Date:** received April 1, 2025

> Dear Colleagues:
>  
> As I begin my tenure as the 18th Director of the National Institutes of Health, I want to first express my appreciation for all of you — the NIH scientists and staff whose work has contributed to lifesaving breakthroughs in biology and medicine. I most recently worked at Stanford University where my research in health economics was made possible with NIH support. I am honored and humbled to lead this agency and join you in service of the American people.
>  
> As a doctor, economist, and (now former) professor at Stanford University, I have always been driven by a passion for improving public health and fostering an environment where scientific inquiry can flourish. Throughout my career, I have been supported by NIH, an institution that I love.
>  
> NIH's mission to enhance health remains vital as millions of children and adults in this country face poor outcomes due to chronic diseases like obesity, heart disease, and cancer. We must build on the agency’s track record of tackling complex challenges and recommit to our mission to addressing the chronic disease crisis. While basic research will continue to lay the groundwork for future discoveries, we will invest in innovative, cutting-edge research that has the power to transform health. Importantly, our discoveries will only make an impact if the public has confidence in our findings and trusts that we are working in their best interests.
>  
> To help us achieve these goals, I have established the following five top priorities:
> 
> Focus on Improving Population Health: The work of NIH, whether basic or applied, must address the health needs of the American people, including the chronic disease crises that have hampered the well-being of countless Americans.
> Reproducibility and Rigor: The research NIH conducts and supports must be rigorous, reproducible, and unbiased. NIH must address and solve the reproducibility crisis in the biomedical sciences.
> 
> Innovation and Collaboration: NIH must be at the forefront of biomedical innovation. This will involve embracing new technologies, new ideas, and new approaches to old problems.
> 
> Research Safety and Transparency: NIH must ensure that all the experiments we support pose no risk of harm to human populations and meet the highest ethical standards. We must maintain the highest standards of transparency in all our endeavors.
> 
> Academic Freedom: Advances in science require the freedom to think differently from the scientific consensus. I will foster an environment where varied perspectives are valued and encouraged at NIH and the broader scientific community.
> 
> I recognize that I am joining NIH at a time of tremendous change. Every inch of the federal government is under scrutiny—and NIH is not exempt. As a result of the Department of Health and Human Services’ streamlining effort and upcoming reorganization, NIH experienced a significant reduction in its workforce. Many of our valued colleagues are losing their jobs, which is in no way a reflection of the quality of their work. I want to express my deepest gratitude to those who will be affected for all you have contributed to the mission of NIH. These reductions in the workforce will have a profound impact on key NIH administrative functions, including communications, legislative affairs, procurement, and human resources, and will require an entirely new approach to how we carry them out. As we navigate these challenges, I will do my best to lead NIH through these reforms, implement new policies humanely, and endeavor to earn your trust.
>  
> I know we all agree that it is a privilege for us to do science to improve the health of all Americans. Thank you for your efforts and dedication to the great mission of NIH.
>  
> All the best,
>  
> Jay Bhattacharya, M.D., Ph.D.
> NIH Director
