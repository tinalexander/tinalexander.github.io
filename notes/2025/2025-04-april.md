- **Date:** occurred April 7, 2025

> Robert F. Kennedy Jr., HHS 17:27:26
> 
> Fluoride should not be in our water. 
> 
> Fluoride had a strong justification in the 1940s, when it was added, and people didn't understand the science and they thought its benefit to our teeth was systemic. 
> 
> And by drinking it, it would enter your body and somehow protect their teeth. 
> 
> Now we know that there is no systemic advantage, zero systemic advantage, and that the only advantage comes from topical application. 
> 
> So it's the water that passes it through your mouth. You can achieve that benefit from brushing your teeth and in the era of fluoridated toothpastes and mouth washes, it makes no sense to have fluoride in our water. 
> 
> The evidence against fluoride is overwhelming.
> 
> In animals, in animal models and in human models, we know that it causes IQ loss, profound IQ loss, and it's dose related. 
> 
> So if the more fluoride you get the higher levels in your drinking water, your urine, the more likely it is you lose IQ. And also other neurological injuries like ADHD. 
> 
> It affects-- there's science that indicates that it affects kidney health, that it affects liver health, that it causes hyperthyroidism, that it causes osteoarthritis. 
> 
> Women who are more exposed have up to 50% more hip fractures and than women who are unexposed. 
> 
> It causes fluoridasis in between 40 and 80% of our kids. 
> 
> It makes no sense to have it in our water supply. And I'm very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban it. And I hope many more will come. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Lee Zeldin, EPA 17:30:32
> 
> As soon as I was nominated by President Trump as administrator of the EPA, the secretary instantly reached out to start talking about issues that he is so passionate about. 
> 
> And number one on that list was fluoride. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Question 17:35:30 
> 
> You said a few days ago that HHS was going to be reinstating some jobs that were cut. Your staff then said that's not happening. Can you clarify? Is it? Are there programs that you believe should be reinstated?
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 17:35:37 
> 
> No, the program-- what I said was that there are programs that there are-- the programs have been consolidated. 
> 
> So we didn't cut any core programs or any critical care programs or any scientific programs. 
> 
> Those programs are being consolidated in a new agency that is going to make America healthy again.
> 
> Question 17:35:57
> 
> Nothing is being reinstated?
> 
> Mike Schultz 17:36:01
> 
> So let's move on to another question.
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 17:36:24
> 
> It evolved when I read the science.
> 
> I think I read it most carefully in the last couple of years and the science evolved. 
> 
> The national toxicity program issued its report in August. And that report was devastating. 
> 
> And, I don't think-- I think we need to apply the precautionary principle in this country that we should do no harm. And it clearly is doing harm.
> 
> I mean, the trade off is IQ loss in kids and what-- we can't afford that in this country, we need all the brain power that we can to handle the challenges of the future. 
> 
> And then the other health impacts which are less clearly documented in the science, because they have not been completely well studied, but they are alarming enough that we shouldn't be demanding that parents accept something for their children and in their homes, that is essentially a medication.
> 
> So they can go to the drugstore and they can get toothpaste. They can, if you want to apply it in your home, you can, you can get mouthwash. 
> 
> And I believe, and I think it's a moral imperative that we all believe, in freedom of choice in this country. It is one of the bedrock principles of our democracy that the government shouldn't be making decisions, intimate decisions, about our own lives. 
> 
> And then, just the science is overwhelming on it now. It doesn't make any sense.

> Robert F Kennedy Jr [15:01:51]
> 
> In terms of FDA's capacity, the cuts in all of our agencies are not affecting science, so that science jobs are preserved. 
> 
> The frontline enforcement jobs and health delivery jobs are preserved. 
> 
> We-- HHS was a bloated agency and it was not doing its job. 
> 
> Our health-- during the past four years, we saw a 38% rise in its budget and healthcare continue to decline. 
> 
> So we're reorganizing HHS, so we can do its intended job, which is to make America healthy again.
> 
> ...
> 
> Question [15:04:11]
> 
> I know you said that you want to talk about kids' health. The CDC program that monitors lead surveillance for kids was cut. Can you explain the rationale for cutting a program like that? And why that's not an essential service?
> 
> Robert F Kennedy Jr [15:04:24]
> 
> There were some programs that were cut that are being reinstated. And I believe that that's one of them.
> 
> Question [15:04:30]
> 
> Interesting, and do you know why it was cut to begin with? It was--
> 
> Robert F Kennedy Jr [15:04:34]
> 
> All of these programs, all of the CDC, NIH, and CDC were not doing their jobs. And there was tremendous redundancies. 
> 
> For example, we had over a hundred communications departments. We had 40 procurement departments. We had dozens of IT departments and dozens of HR departments. 
> 
> Most of the cuts are to those administrative sections, which are now consolidating or eliminating the redundancies. We're streamlining the agencies. 
> 
> We're going to make it work for public health, make it work for the American people. 
> 
> In the course of that, there were a number of instances where studies that should have not have been cut, were cut. And we've reinstated them. 
> 
> Personnel that should not have been cut, were cut. We're reinstating them. And that was always the plan. 
> 
> Part of the DOGE, we talked about this from the beginning, is we're going to do 80% cuts, but 20% of those are going to have to be reinstated,  because we'll make mistakes. 
> 
> And one of the things that President Trump has said is that if we make mistakes, we're going to admit it and we're going to remedy it. 
> 
> And that's one of the mistakes. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Robert F Kennedy Jr [15:07:34]
> 
> We're in the middle of right now, very, very energetically, revising the nutrition guidelines.
> 
> The nutrition guidelines that were worked out during the Biden administration and that we're supposed to be implemented on January 20th, there's a 453 page document that looks like it was written by the food processing industry. 
> 
> And we're-- we are going to come up with a document that is simple, that lets people know, with great clarity, what kind of foods their children need to eat? What kind of foods they can eat. And what's good for them. What's good nutrition. 
> 
> And then we are collaborating with each other to make sure we get that out as quickly as possible.

## Email to Vet-LIRN laboratories about FDA's RIF

- **Source:** email
- **Attribution:** obtained by CBS News
- **Date:** received April 3, 2025

```
Dear Network Laboratories,
Unfortunately, significant Reductions In Force (RIF), including a key
quality assurance officer, at FDA's Human Food Program Moffett Center
has caused immediate and significant impact on the Veterinary
Laboratory Investigation and Response Network (Vet-LIRN) Proficiency
Exercise Program. The RIF affected nearly all FDA staff at Moffett,
including the scientific staff that develop and issue the proficiency test
(PT) samples, analyze data, and create reports. The Moffett Center is an
ISO accredited PT provider that supports the PT needs of Vet-LIRN, the
Food Emergency Response Network (FERN), as well as FDA Grade A
Milk and Shellfish programs, and others.
We regret to inform you that the Interlaboratory Comparison Exercise for
detecting Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in milk (HPAI ICE-1), set to
ship later this month, is suspended.
The HPAI ICE-1, which included over 40 registered labs across the Vet-
LIRN and NAHLN networks, as well as FDA food labs and private
industry, would have been critical to ensure confidence in the laboratory
methods for food safety and animal health. We are still assessing the full
extent of the impact and will send Vet-LIRN wide messaging on this
exercise in the near future.
Additionally, we regret to share that Vet-LIRN's Proficiency Exercise
Program is suspended for at least the remainder of FY25. Since 2010,
we have conducted 40 proficiency exercises, ensuring laboratory
preparedness for major animal food safety issues, including the detection
of Salmonella and Aflatoxin in pet food. The program also supported the
implementation of new methods and technologies and was instrumental
during the COVID-19 pandemic to maintain confidence in testing for
humans and animals.
We are disappointed to share this news but wanted to keep you informed.
Thank you for your continued dedication and contribution to the Vet-LIRN
program. We will provide more updates as they are available.
Thank you,
Vet-LIRN Program Office

## FDA's Marty Makary speaks to agency staff

- **Source:** [video](https://youtu.be/BRpzI01WVew)

- **Date:** occurred April 2, 2025

> Sara Brenner, FDA [00:04:30]
> 
> I want to briefly acknowledge and introduce those new colleagues who are here today, to you, again.
> 
> You already know Jim Traficant is our new chief of staff-- now it gets fun, because I get a point to you, and you have to stand up and wave. No, I'm just kidding. It's killing me to stay on script, but I'm doing it right. I'm doing it. 
> 
> Okay, Jim Traficant, our new chief of staff and I hope you've had the chance to read a little bit of his bio that went out in the all hands. Suffice it to say, Jim has had extensive executive and operational leadership experience supporting federal state commercial and international healthcare organizations. 
> 
> Importantly, he also happens to have a long friendship with Dr Makary and will be able to help effectively translate and advance his priorities here at FDA. 
> 
> You also likely read a little bit about-- thank you, very good, welcome Jim. 
> 
> You've also likely read about our new acting head of the FDA's human foods program, Kyle Diamantas-- there he is-- who has experience in the food sector and is well versed in the federal food drug and cosmetic act, as well as FDA's operational framework. 
> 
> He has extensive experience working with federal and state agencies, scientific organizations, consumer advocacy groups, and industry stakeholders. He also has a wide ranging experience spanning regulatory compliance, investigation enforcement and rule making. 
> 
> The third person I want to acknowledge today is Grace Graham. Where is Grace? Other side, okay. To keep people on their toes and the cameras are swiveling. No. So Grace is with our office of policy legislation and international affairs. Grace has a distinguished history in healthcare and legislative affairs, having served in a variety of positions in both houses of Congress. Most recently as chief health counsel in the house. And before that, as health policy director of the Senate health education, labor and pensions committee, she's also very familiar with the FDA's work, having served as a policy advisor in the Senate on FDA matters. Grace already started working in OPLIA. And so we look forward to her continued leadership. 
> 
> Most of you probably saw the all hands that went out last week, announcing another of our new members, our new deputy commissioner for operations and our chief operating officer, Dr. Barclay Butler. Barclay has more than 40 years of experience leading organizations through significant transformational change in both the public and private sectors. In addition to working in the private sector, he spent nearly a decade with the defense health agency. Most recently as assistant director for support. From 2012 to 14, Barclay was director of the interagency program office with the department of defense. 
> 
> All right. We have two late breaking additions here. Dr. Tracy Beth Høeg. Did she make to the front? Second? Here we go-- also very good-- also joined the agency last week as special assistant to the commissioner. 
> 
> Tracy has extensive experience working in vaccine science and epidemiology, including for MIT's Sloan School of Management and as an adjunct associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark. 
> 
> And then just yesterday, Dr. Scott Steele, who is virtual with us today, Scott was named FDA's acting director for the center for biologics evaluation and research. Dr. Steele is a science technology and policy professional with extensive experience in multiple disciplines, including emerging science and technology, translational science, public health preparedness, and biodefense and medical countermeasures. 
> 
> So after what's been a very hard week and a very hard several days and hours, I'd enjoy-- I'd encourage you to focus on and look forward to the future with this very strong group of leaders. We are ready to move forward and we are thrilled to be working with someone of the statue-- of the stature of Dr. Makary, but we do have a lot of work to do. It is a critical time in the health of our nation with many challenges before us. 
> 
> I know that Dr. Makary has many priorities that he is eager to begin work on. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Marty Makary, FDA [00:15:26]
> 
> Our country desperately needs you. They desperately need you and your ideas. 
> 
> They need the FDA's scientists to ensure public safety, examine root causes of other medical problems that are unforeseen, using the disciplines of toxicology, environmental health, food safety, and basic scientific methodology, you are in a unique position to address many of these problems one small piece at a time.
> 
> Our generation's new chronic disease epidemic also means that we need novel therapies, cures, and meaningful treatments. It also means that we need new approaches. We need fresh new ideas.
> 
> To do this, we have to listen to one another, a lesson that applies in my opinion, to our broader polarized society. We need to recognize nuance, promote civil discourse. In fact, science has always been based on debating and discussing different ideas, different opinions in the scientific sphere among experts are good. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Marty Makary, FDA [00:17:12]
> 
> Allowing experts to debate new approaches to old problems is exactly what we need right now. Our country is sick. Obesity is not a willpower problem. Food deserts are not a genetic issue. 
> 
> To address the biggest health needs of this country, we need new ideas and fresh new perspectives. We need open-mindedness and a willingness to challenge deeply held assumptions just as scientists did in challenging opioids were not addictive. That sugar is healthy. That smoking is not bad for you. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Marty Makary, FDA [00:19:50]
> 
> I want to be very clear. I value the career staff at the FDA enormously and the wisdom that all of you hold. 
> 
> I will be meeting with many of you, as many as possible, to learn and to find out how I can best support your work as we adapt to the new world of medical innovation and discovery, at a time when we are dealing with a worsening health of the population.
> 
> I know the last few months have been difficult and the last few days have been particularly hard. 
> 
> I want you to know that you have my commitment that I will do everything possible to make sure that scientists, clinicians, inspectors, investigators, and core staff central to the mission and operations of this agency will have all the resources they need to do their job. 
> 
> And I will do my best.

## HHS official on background about restructuring of department

- **Source:** emailed statement
- **Attribution:** on background to a Department of Health and Human Services official
- **Date:** received April 2, 2025

> Last Thursday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced a dramatic restructuring in accordance with President Trump's Executive Order, “Implementing the President’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Workforce Optimization Initiative.” This overhaul is about realigning HHS with its core mission: to stop the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again. Despite spending $1.9 trillion in annual costs, Americans are getting sicker every year, and we must shift course.
> 
> The reorganization is being done in phases. The first phase was last week’s announcement to inform American taxpayers how HHS will produce better health outcomes for them and their families. The second phase rolled out Tuesday, was to notify roughly 10,000 employees who were impacted as part of the reduction in force. HHS leaders focused personnel cuts on redundant or unnecessary administrative positions.
> 
> Here are some of the best examples: 
>  
> • Despite only having 28 divisions, HHS had 41 Chief Information Officers. 
> 
> • There were 1,400 external affairs officers. 
> 
> • HHS had 100 communications offices. 
> 
> • HHS had 40 procurement departments. 
> 
> • There were dozens of IT departments. 
> 
> • There were dozens of HR departments. 
> 
> • There were more than 8 Senior Finance Officials. 
> 
> HHS also reduced its regional footprint by moving out of the highest cost cities, shuttering offices in Boston, Chicago, NYC, San Francisco, and Seattle. The reorganization from 28 to 15 divisions is necessary, but critical programs amongst these divisions will continue under the new operational structure.
> 
> The Department is now detailing the structure of each redefined division to streamline operations, enhance responsiveness to the American people, and ultimately improve the nation’s health as part of the Make America Healthy Again initiative.
> 
> HHS will notify external stakeholders, including Congress and will comply with all statutory requirements.

> Dear Colleagues:
>  
> As I begin my tenure as the 18th Director of the National Institutes of Health, I want to first express my appreciation for all of you — the NIH scientists and staff whose work has contributed to lifesaving breakthroughs in biology and medicine. I most recently worked at Stanford University where my research in health economics was made possible with NIH support. I am honored and humbled to lead this agency and join you in service of the American people.
>  
> As a doctor, economist, and (now former) professor at Stanford University, I have always been driven by a passion for improving public health and fostering an environment where scientific inquiry can flourish. Throughout my career, I have been supported by NIH, an institution that I love.
>  
> NIH's mission to enhance health remains vital as millions of children and adults in this country face poor outcomes due to chronic diseases like obesity, heart disease, and cancer. We must build on the agency’s track record of tackling complex challenges and recommit to our mission to addressing the chronic disease crisis. While basic research will continue to lay the groundwork for future discoveries, we will invest in innovative, cutting-edge research that has the power to transform health. Importantly, our discoveries will only make an impact if the public has confidence in our findings and trusts that we are working in their best interests.
>  
> To help us achieve these goals, I have established the following five top priorities:
> 
> Focus on Improving Population Health: The work of NIH, whether basic or applied, must address the health needs of the American people, including the chronic disease crises that have hampered the well-being of countless Americans.
> Reproducibility and Rigor: The research NIH conducts and supports must be rigorous, reproducible, and unbiased. NIH must address and solve the reproducibility crisis in the biomedical sciences.
> 
> Innovation and Collaboration: NIH must be at the forefront of biomedical innovation. This will involve embracing new technologies, new ideas, and new approaches to old problems.
> 
> Research Safety and Transparency: NIH must ensure that all the experiments we support pose no risk of harm to human populations and meet the highest ethical standards. We must maintain the highest standards of transparency in all our endeavors.
> 
> Academic Freedom: Advances in science require the freedom to think differently from the scientific consensus. I will foster an environment where varied perspectives are valued and encouraged at NIH and the broader scientific community.
> 
> I recognize that I am joining NIH at a time of tremendous change. Every inch of the federal government is under scrutiny—and NIH is not exempt. As a result of the Department of Health and Human Services’ streamlining effort and upcoming reorganization, NIH experienced a significant reduction in its workforce. Many of our valued colleagues are losing their jobs, which is in no way a reflection of the quality of their work. I want to express my deepest gratitude to those who will be affected for all you have contributed to the mission of NIH. These reductions in the workforce will have a profound impact on key NIH administrative functions, including communications, legislative affairs, procurement, and human resources, and will require an entirely new approach to how we carry them out. As we navigate these challenges, I will do my best to lead NIH through these reforms, implement new policies humanely, and endeavor to earn your trust.
>  
> I know we all agree that it is a privilege for us to do science to improve the health of all Americans. Thank you for your efforts and dedication to the great mission of NIH.
>  
> All the best,
>  
> Jay Bhattacharya, M.D., Ph.D.
> NIH Director
